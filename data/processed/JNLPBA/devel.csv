( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ),O O O O O O O
The exon - intron structure of the 5 ' portion of the thromboxane receptor gene was determined initially by comparing the nucleotide sequence of the 5 ' flanking genomic clone with that of a novel human uterine thromboxane receptor cDNA that extended the mRNA 141 bp further upstream than the previously identified human placental cDNA .,O B I I I O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O B I O O B I I I I O O O O B I I I I I O O O B B I I I O O B I I I I O
