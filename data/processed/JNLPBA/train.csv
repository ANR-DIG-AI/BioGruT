IL - 2 gene expression and NF - kappa B activation through CD28 requires reactive oxygen production by 5 - lipoxygenase .,B I I I O O B I I I O O B O O O O O B I I O
Activation of the CD28 surface receptor provides a major costimulatory signal for T cell activation resulting in enhanced production of interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) and cell proliferation .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O
In primary T lymphocytes we show that CD28 ligation leads to the rapid intracellular formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) which are required for CD28 - mediated activation of the NF - kappa B / CD28 - responsive complex and IL - 2 expression .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O B I I O O
"Delineation of the CD28 signaling cascade was found to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity , followed by the activation of phospholipase A2 and 5 - lipoxygenase .",O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I O B I I O
These findings should be useful for therapeutic strategies and the development of immunosuppressants targeting the CD28 costimulatory pathway .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The peri - kappa B site mediates human immunodeficiency virus type 2 enhancer activation in monocytes but not in T cells .,O B I I I I O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O
HIV - 1 and HIV - 2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Consistent with these differences , we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer / promoter region of HIV - 2 functions quite differently from that of HIV - 1 .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Whereas activation of the HIV - 1 enhancer following T - cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF - kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat , activation of the HIV - 2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis - acting elements : a single kappa B site , two purine - rich binding sites , PuB1 and PuB2 , and a pets site .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I I O O O B I I O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I O O B I I I I O B O B O O O B I O
"We have now identified a novel cis - acting element within the HIV - 2 enhancer , immediately upstream of the kappa B site , designated peri - kappa B .",O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O
"This site is conserved among isolates of HIV - 2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus , and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV - 2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but not T - cell lines .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Further , while specific constitutive binding to the peri - kappa B site is seen in monocytes , stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional , specific binding .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
E1A gene expression induces susceptibility to killing by NK cells following immortalization but not adenovirus infection of human cells .,B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Adenovirus ( Ad ) infection and E1A transfection were used to model changes in susceptibility to NK cell killing caused by transient vs stable E1A expression in human cells .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"Only stably transfected target cells exhibited cytolytic susceptibility , despite expression of equivalent levels of E1A proteins in Ad - infected targets .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
The inability of E1A gene products to induce cytolytic susceptibility during infection was not explained by an inhibitory effect of viral infection on otherwise susceptible target cells or by viral gene effects on class I MHC antigen expression on target cells .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I O O O O O
This differential effect of E1A expression on the cytolytic phenotypes of infected and stably transfected human cells suggests that human NK cells provide an effective immunologic barrier against the in vivo survival and neoplastic progression of E1A - immortalized cells that may emerge from the reservoir of persistently infected cells in the human host .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The CD4 coreceptor interacts with non - polymorphic regions of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen - presenting cells and contributes to T cell activation .,O B I O O B I I I O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have investigated the effect of CD4 triggering on T cell activating signals in a lymphoma model using monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) which recognize different CD4 epitopes .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O B I O
We demonstrate that CD4 triggering delivers signals capable of activating the NF - AT transcription factor which is required for interleukin - 2 gene expression .,O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I O O O
Lack of full activation of NF - AT could be correlated to a dramatically reduced capacity to induce calcium flux and could be complemented with a calcium ionophore .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results identify functionally distinct epitopes on the CD4 coreceptor involved in activation of the Ras / protein kinase C and calcium pathways .,O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O B I I I I O O O O
Ligand - dependent repression of the erythroid transcription factor GATA - 1 by the estrogen receptor .,O O O O O O B I I B I I O O B I O
High - dose estrogen administration induces anemia in mammals .,O O O O O O O O O O
"In chickens , estrogens stimulate outgrowth of bone marrow - derived erythroid progenitor cells and delay their maturation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This delay is associated with down - regulation of many erythroid cell - specific genes , including alpha - and beta - globin , band 3 , band 4 . 1 , and the erythroid cell - specific histone H5 .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I B O
We show here that estrogens also reduce the number of erythroid progenitor cells in primary human bone marrow cultures .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of GATA - 1 is strongly repressed by the estrogen receptor ( ER ) in a ligand - dependent manner and that this repression is reversible in the presence of 4 - hydroxytamoxifen .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GATA - 1 and ER bind to each other in vitro in the absence of DNA .,B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Mapping experiments indicate that GATA - 1 and the ER form at least two contacts , which involve the finger region and the N - terminal activation domain of GATA - 1 .",O O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O
We speculate that estrogens exert effects on erythropoiesis by modulating GATA - 1 activity through protein - protein interaction with the ER .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O
Mouse interleukin - 2 receptor alpha gene expression .,B I I I I I I O O
Interleukin - 1 and interleukin - 2 control transcription via distinct cis - acting elements .,B I I O B I I O O O O B I I I O
We have shown that interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) and IL - 2 control IL - 2 receptor alpha ( IL - 2R alpha ) gene transcription in CD4 - CD8 - murine T lymphocyte precursors .,O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we map the cis - acting elements that mediate interleukin responsiveness of the mouse IL - 2R alpha gene using a thymic lymphoma - derived hybridoma ( PC60 ) .,O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"IL - 1 induces a rapid , protein synthesis - independent appearance of IL - 2R alpha mRNA that is blocked by inhibitors of NF - kappa B activation .",B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O
This segment functions as an IL - 2 - inducible enhancer and lies within a region that becomes DNase I hypersensitive in normal T cells in which IL - 2R alpha expression has been induced .,O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
IL - 2 responsiveness requires three distinct elements within the enhancer .,B I I O O O O B O O B O
Two of these are potential binding sites for STAT proteins .,O O O O O O O O B I O
Hematopoietic lineage commitment : role of transcription factors .,O O O O O O B I O
This review focuses on the roles of transcription factors in hematopoietic lineage commitment .,O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
A brief introduction to lineage commitment and asymmetric cell division is followed by a discussion of several methods used to identify transcription factors important in specifying hematopoietic cell types .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
Next is presented a discussion of the use of embryonic stem cells in the analysis of hematopoietic gene expression and the use of targeted gene disruption to analyze the role of transcription factors in hematopoiesis .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
"Finally , the status of our current knowledge concerning the roles of transcription factors in the commitment to erythroid , myeloid and lymphoid cell types is summarized .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Epstein - Barr virus replicative gene transcription during de novo infection of human thymocytes : simultaneous early expression of BZLF - 1 and its repressor RAZ .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B O
We and others have shown that EBV can also infect a subset of thymocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Infection of thymocytes was accompanied by the appearance of linear EBV genome within 8 hr of infection .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
Circularization of the EBV genome was not detected .,O O O B I O O O O
This is in contrast to the infection in B cells where the genome can circularize within 24 hr of infection .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The appearance of a novel fusion transcript ( RAZ ) , which comprised regions of the BZLF - 1 locus and the adjacent BRLF - 1 locus , was detected by RT - PCR .",O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
ZEBRA protein was also identified in infected thymocytes by immunoprecipitation .,B I O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , we demonstrated that the EBNA - 1 gene in infected thymocytes was transcribed from the Fp promoter , rather than from the Cp / Wp promoter which is used in latently infected B cells .",O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
These observations suggest that de novo EBV infection of thymocytes differs from infection of B cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Identification and purification of human Stat proteins activated in response to interleukin - 2 .,O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O
A key cytokine induced during the immune response is IL - 2 .,O O B O O O O O O B I I O
"Following T cell activation , the genes encoding IL - 2 and the various chains of its receptor are transcriptionally induced .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"In turn , secreted IL - 2 serves to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Following this lead , we set out to identify transcription factors induced in response to IL - 2 .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I I O
Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were observed to contain several IL - 2 - inducible DNA binding activities .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
"Similar activities were also observed in a transformed human lymphocyte line , termed YT .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have purified these activities and found that the principal IL - 2 - inducible component bears significant relatedness to a prolactin - induced transcription factor first identified in sheep mammary gland tissue .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O
"We hypothesize that activation of this protein , designated hStat5 , helps govern the biological effects of IL - 2 during the immune response .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
"E2F - 1 and a cyclin - like DNA repair enzyme , uracil - DNA glycosylase , provide evidence for an autoregulatory mechanism for transcription .",B I I O O B I I I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"The cell cycle - dependent transcription factor , E2F - 1 , regulates the cyclin - like species of the DNA repair enzyme uracil - DNA glycosylase ( UDG ) gene in human osteosarcoma ( Saos - 2 ) cells .",O B I I I I I O B I I O O O B O O O O O B I I B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"The major putative downstream site for E2F , located in the first exon , serves as a target for E2F - 1 / DP1 complex binding in vitro .",O B I I I O B O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O
We also provide evidence for the functional relationship between the cyclin - like UDG gene product and E2F .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O
High levels of UDG expression in a transient transfection assay result in the down - regulation of transcriptional activity through elements specific for E2F - mediated transcription .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O
"This hypothetical model integrates one mechanism of DNA repair with the cell cycle control of gene transcription , likely through E2F .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"This implicates E2F as a multifunctional target for proteins and enzymes , possibly , responsive to DNA damage through the negative effect of UDG on E2F - mediated transcriptional activity .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
Interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) is an important immunoregulatory protein produced predominantly by T cells and large granular lymphocytes ( LGL ) in response to different extracellular signals .,B I I O B I I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In particular , two interleukins ( ILs ) , IL - 2 and IL - 12 , have been shown to be potent inducers of IFN - gamma gene expression in both T cells and LGL .",O O O O B O B O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Although it has been reported that there are some T cell lines that produce IFN - gamma in response to IL - 2 and IL - 12 stimulation , there has as yet been no report of a natural killer ( NK ) cell line that responds in a similar manner .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this report we present evidence that the cell line NK3 . 3 derived from human NK cells , responds to both IL - 2 and IL - 12 , as measured by increases in IFN - gamma and granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) cytoplasmic mRNA and protein expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O
"The results suggest that activation of protein kinase C , but not new protein synthesis , is required for IL - 2 induction of IFN - gamma and GM - CSF cytoplasmic mRNA .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I I O
"In contrast , IL - 12 induction of IFN - gamma cytoplasmic mRNA appears to only partially depend on activation of protein kinase C .",O O O B I I O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Furthermore , both transforming growth factor - beta and genistein , a tyrosine kinase inhibitor , could suppress IL - 2 and IL - 12 signaling but CsA was generally inactive .",O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O
It also was observed that suppression of cytokine gene expression by these agents was independent of the inhibition of proliferation .,O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These data indicate that IL - 2 and IL - 12 may have distinct signaling pathways leading to the induction of IFN - gamma and GM - CSF gene expression , and that the NK3 . 3 cell line may serve as a novel model for dissecting the biochemical and molecular events involved in these pathways .",O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A functional T - cell receptor signaling pathway is required for p95vav activity .,O O B I I I O O O O O B O O
"Stimulation of the T - cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) induces activation of multiple tyrosine kinases , resulting in phosphorylation of numerous intracellular substrates .",O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
"It contains a number of structural motifs , including Src homology 2 , Src homology 3 , and pleckstrin homology domains and a putative guanine nucleotide exchange domain .",O O O O O B I O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O B I I I I O
The role of p95vav in TCR - mediated signaling processes is unclear .,O O O B O B O O O O O O O
"Here , we show that overexpression of p95vav alone in Jurkat T cells leads to activation of the nuclear factors , including NFAT , involved in interleukin - 2 expression .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O B I I O O
"In contrast , NFAT activation by a G - protein - coupled receptor is not modulated by p95vav overexpression , suggesting that the effect is specific to the TCR signaling pathways .",O O O B O O O B I I I I I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
"Although removal of the first 67 amino acids of p95vav activates its transforming potential in NIH 3T3 cells , this region appears to be required for its function in T cells .",O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We further demonstrate that the p95vav - induced NFAT activation is not mimicked by Ras activation , though its function is dependent upon Ras and Raf .",O O O O O B O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O B O
"To further dissect p95vav involvement in TCR signaling , we analyzed various Jurkat mutants deficient in TCR signaling function or TCR expression and showed that an intact TCR signaling pathway is required for p95vav to function .",O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O
"However , overexpression of p95vav does not appear to influence TCR - induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation or increases in cytoplasmic free calcium .",O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Taken together , our data suggest that p95vav plays an important role at an yet unidentified proximal position in the TCR signaling cascade .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
"Positive and negative regulation of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor promoter activity by AML1 - related transcription factor , PEBP2 .",O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I I I I O B O
"The granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) gene promoter contains a consensus sequence for the polyomavirus enhancer binding - protein 2 ( PEBP2 ) transcription factor , which consists of alpha and beta subunits .",O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O O O O B I I I O
"There are at least two genes , alpha A and alpha B , encoding the alpha subunit .",O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O B I O
"PEBP2 alpha A1 , alpha B1 , and alpha B2 proteins bound the PEBP2 site within the mouse GM - CSF promoter .",B I I O B I O O B I I O O B I O O B I I I I O
PEBP2 alpha A1 and alpha B1 enhanced the expression of the GM - CSF promoter - driven reporter plasmid in unstimulated and 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol 13 - acetate / phytohemagglutinin - stimulated human Jurkat T cells .,B I I O B I O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , the promoter activity was suppressed by alpha B2 .",O O O O O O O O O B I O
Coexpression of alpha B1 and alpha B2 showed that the promoter activity could be determined by the alpha B1 / alpha B2 ratio .,O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I O O
Jurkat cell extract contained PEBP2 site - binding protein ( s ) that cross - reacted with antimouse alpha A1 antibodies .,O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Northern blot analysis indicated the expression of human PEBP2 alpha A , alpha B ( AML1 ) , and beta genes in Jurkat cells .",O O O O O O O O B I I O B I O B O O O B I O O O O
"The augmentation of LPS responses by interferon gamma ( IFN - gamma ) , referred to as priming , is well established .",O O O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , the mechanism ( s ) by which priming occurs is poorly defined .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Using tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) induction as a model , experiments were designed to analyse in detail the priming effect on the LPS response in human monocytes .",O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Priming by IFN - gamma was primarily manifested at the level of TNF mRNA accumulation .,O O B I I O O O O O O O B I O O
IFN - gamma pre - treatment affected the magnitude rather than the sensitivity of the LPS response .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Priming occurred after several hours of treatment , and the primed state was induced by either IFN - gamma or GM - CSF , but not M - CSF .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O B I I O
Primed monocytes transcribed TNF mRNA at a higher rate than freshly isolated monocytes upon activation with LPS .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An additional significant finding was than TNF mRNA induced in primed cells was much more stable than in unprimed cells ( T1 / 2 increased 6 - 8 - fold ) .,O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The CD4 promoter plays an important role in the developmental control of CD4 transcription .,O B I O O O O O O O O O B O O
"In this report , we show that the minimal CD4 promoter has four factor binding sites , each of which is required for full function .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Using biochemical and mutagenesis analyses , we determined that multiple nuclear factors bind to these independent sites .",O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
We determined that an initiator - like sequence present at the cap site and an Ets consensus sequence are required for full promoter function .,O O O O B I I I O O O B I O O B I I O O O O B O O
We also demonstrate that the Myc - associated zinc finger protein ( MAZ ) appears to be the predominant factor binding to one of these sites .,O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
This last site closely resembles the ME1a1 G3AG4AG3 motif previously shown to be a critical element in the P2 promoter of the c - myc gene .,O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I O
We therefore believe that the MAZ transcription factor is also likely to play an important role in the control of developmental expression of the CD4 gene .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Erythropoietin stimulates transcription of the TAL1 / SCL gene and phosphorylation of its protein products .,B O O O O B I I I O O O O B I O
"Activation of the TAL1 ( or SCL ) gene , originally identified through its involvement by a recurrent chromosomal translocation , is the most frequent molecular lesion recognized in T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia .",O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The protein products of this gene contain the basic - helix - loop - helix motif characteristic of a large family of transcription factors that bind to the canonical DNA sequence CANNTG as protein heterodimers .,O B I O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I O O O O B I I I O B I O
TAL1 expression by erythroid cells in vivo and in chemical - induced erythroleukemia cell lines in vivo suggested the gene might regulate aspects of erythroid differentiation .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Epo elicited a rapid , dose - related increase in TAL1 mRNA by increasing transcription of the gene and stabilizing one of its mRNAs .",B O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B O
An Epo - inducible TAL1 DNA binding activity was identified in FVA cell nuclear extracts that subsequently decayed despite accumulating mRNA and protein .,O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Induction of DNA binding activity was associated temporally with Epo - induced phosphorylation of nuclear TAL1 protein .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O
These results indicate that Epo acts at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels on the TAL1 locus in Friend virus - induced erythroblasts and establish a link between Epo signaling mechanisms and a member of a family of transcription factors involved in the differentiation of diverse cell lineages .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
Nonradioactive quantification of glucocorticoid receptor expression during differentiation of human monocytic cells ( U937 ) .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
We describe a method for relative quantification of specific mRNA using a nonradioactive assay based on DNA strand competition between identical sequences of biotin - and fluorescein - labeled amplicon ( probe ) and unlabeled amplicon ( target ) during hybridization .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"As the target quantity increased , that of the double - labeled probe decreased in accordance with the mass action law .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This technique was successfully applied to evaluate differences in glucocorticoid receptor expression in U937 cells before and after the addition of potent differentiation inducers : 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol 13 - acetate ( TPA ) and a combination of all - trans retinoic acid ( RA ) and 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D2 ( VD ) .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We observed that TPA treatment was associated with an increase in specific binding of [ 3H ] dexamethasone and up - regulation of GR mRNA while no enhanced GR expression was perceived with RA / VD treatment .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Induction of Sp1 phosphorylation and NF - kappa B - independent HIV promoter domain activity in T lymphocytes stimulated by okadaic acid .,O O B O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast to the purely enhancer - dependent effect of cytokines such as TNF on the activity of the HIV regulatory region ( LTR ) , we observed that okadaic acid ( OKA ) activates HIV transcription through both the enhancer , responding to the factor NF - kappa B , and the promoter domain of the LTR .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I O O B O
The inducibility of HIV LTR - driven luciferase expression constructs in lymphoblastoid cells stimulated by OKA depended on both functional Sp1 binding elements and the ability of the TATA box to bind the protein TBP .,O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I O O O O B O

It contains a core sequence CTTGG . . . CCAAG which is present as part of larger palindromic sequences in each gene .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
This suggest that they may interact with a new family of trans - acting factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"In DNA mobility shift assays , this sequence can give either six different specific bands which are competed out by different parts of the sequence or one specific band which is competed out by each of the inverted repeats , depending on the reconstitution conditions .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The expression of the TINUR gene is induced within 1 h after the cross - linking of the T cell Ag receptor complex .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
TINUR belongs to the NGFI - B / nur77 family of the steroid receptor superfamily and is an orphan receptor .,B O O O B I I I I I O O B I I O O O B I O
TINUR binds to the same DNA sequence as NGFI - B / nur77 .,B O O O O B I O B I I I I O

BACKGROUND : The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) and E - selectin by tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF ) is mediated by mobilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) .,O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O B I I O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O B I B I I I I O B I I I O O
"Since salicylates have been reported to inhibit NF - kappa B activation by preventing the degradation of its inhibitor I kappa B , we studied a potential inhibition of this pathway by acetylsalicylate ( aspirin ) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) .",O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS AND RESULTS : Gel - shift analyses demonstrated dose - dependent inhibition of TNF - induced NF - kappa B mobilization by aspirin at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mmol / L .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Induction of VCAM - 1 and E - selectin surface expression by TNF was dose - dependently reduced by aspirin over the same range , while induction of intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) was hardly affected .",O O B I I O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O O O O O
"Aspirin appeared to prevent VCAM - 1 transcription , since it dose - dependently inhibited induction of VCAM - 1 mRNA by TNF .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O
"As a functional consequence , adhesion of U937 monocytes to TNF - stimulated HUVECs was markedly reduced by aspirin due to suppression of VCAM - 1 and E - selectin upregulation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O
"CONCLUSIONS : Our data suggest that aspirin inhibits NF - kappa B mobilization , induction of VCAM - 1 and E - selectin , and subsequent monocyte adhesion in endothelial cells stimulated by TNF , thereby providing an additional mechanism for therapeutic effects of aspirin .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Activation of NF - kappa B by phosphatase inhibitors involves the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha at phosphatase 2A - sensitive sites .,O O B I I I O B O O O O O B I I I O B I I I I O
"In the present study , the role of serine / threonine phosphatases in the regulation of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation was investigated .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O
"Our studies demonstrate that incubation of human T cells with low concentrations ( approximately 1 - 5 nM ) of calyculin A or okadaic acid , potent inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 1 ( PP - 1 ) and type 2A ( PP - 2A ) , induces the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha even in the absence of any cellular stimulus .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
"This action of the phosphatase inhibitors , which is associated with the activation of the RelA . p50 NF - kappa B heterodimer , is not affected by agents that block the induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O B I I O O
"Furthermore , the phosphorylated I kappa B alpha from calyculin A - treated cells , but not that from TNF - alpha - stimulated cells , is sensitive to PP - 2A in vitro , suggesting the existence of fundamental differences in the phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha induced by the two different NF - kappa B inducers .",O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I O O
"However , induction of I kappa B alpha phosphorylation by both TNF - alpha and the phosphatase inhibitors is associated with the subsequent degradation of I kappa B alpha .",O O O O B I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
We further demonstrate that TNF - alpha - and calyculin A - induced I kappa B alpha degradation exhibits similar but not identical sensitivities to a proteasome inhibitor .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sp1 functions in a chromatin - dependent manner to augment human alpha - globin promoter activity .,B O O O B O O O O O B I I I I O O
"We investigated the role of this G + C - rich region in augmenting alpha - globin promoter activity in the presence of the far - upstream alpha - globin enhancer , HS - 40 .",O O O O O O B I I I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B I I O
"We show that in transiently transfected erythroid cells , deletion of the alpha - globin G + C - rich 5 ' flanking region has no effect on alpha - globin promoter activity .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O B I I I O O
"However , upon stable integration into chromatin , deletion of this region causes a nearly 90 % decrease in promoter activity compared with expression from an alpha - globin promoter retaining this region .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
These results suggest that the alpha - globin G + C - rich 5 ' flanking region augments alpha - globin promoter activity in a chromatin - dependent manner .,O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O B I I I O O O B O O O O
We further show that this G + C - rich region is required for the activation of alpha - globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation .,O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
Costimulation of human CD4 + T cells with LFA - 3 and B7 induce distinct effects on AP - 1 and NF - kappa B transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O B I I I B I O
We have earlier shown that stimulation of human CD4 + T cells with SEA presented on Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) - DR transfectants coexpressing either B7 or LFA - 3 resulted in distinct cytokine profiles .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O B O O
"We now demonstrate that B7 , but not LFA - 3 , strongly costimulated IL - 2 transcription and mRNA expression in CD4 + T cells .",O O O O B O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Maximal increase in IL - 2 transcription was recorded with CHO - DR / B7 / LFA - 3 , suggesting a cooperative effect of B7 and LFA - 3 at the transcriptional level .",O O O B I I O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O
"Gel - shift analysis demonstrated that stimulation of CD4 + T cells with CHO - DR and staphylococcal enterotoxin A was sufficient to induce significant amounts of NF - kappa B binding proteins , whereas induction of AP - 1 binding proteins required costimulation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I O O O
The CHO - DR / B7 / LFA - 3 triple transfectant induced a further increase in AP - 1 and NF - kappa B binding proteins compared with the double transfectants .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I B I O O O O O O
The level of Oct - 1 binding proteins remained similar in all samples .,O O O B I I I I O O O O O O
"Super - shift analysis revealed that the NF - kappa B complex of costimulated CD4 + T cells contained large amounts of p50 , substantial amounts of p65 , and marginal levels of c - Rel proteins .",O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O B I I I O
"The AP - 1 binding proteins contained c - Jun , Jun - D , and Fra - 1 , but marginal amounts of Jun - B and c - Fos .",O B I I I I O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O B I I O B I I O
Our results indicate distinct effects of B7 and LFA - 3 costimulation on the activity of AP - 1 and NF - kappa B .,O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O B I I O B I I I O
These may partly account for the differential effects of B7 and LFA - 3 costimulation on IL - 2 expression .,O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O B I I O O
"2 , 3 , 7 , 8 - tetrachlorodibenzo - p - dioxin ( TCDD ) inhibits murine and human B lymphocyte immunoglobulin production through an unknown mechanism .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study investigated the effect of TCDD on expression of the CD19 gene in a human B lymphocyte cell line .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Northern blot analysis showed that TCDD treatment decreased steady state levels of CD19 mRNA by 67 % in the IM - 9 cell line .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Using a gel mobility shift assay , we identified a DNA - binding complex in IM - 9 nuclear extracts that by several criteria appears to be the Ah receptor .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
These results suggest that the AhR could interfere with BSAP - stimulated CD19 gene transcription by competition for a common DNA binding site .,O O O O O B O O O B O O B I O O O O O O B I I O
Inhibitory action of nm23 proteins on induction of erythroid differentiation of human leukemia cells .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
"nm23 genes encode proteins that participate in tumor metastasis regulation and in various fundamental cellular processes , although their mechanisms of action are still unknown .",B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Although all nm23 proteins contain nucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) kinase activity , it has not been established that the enzyme activity mediated the various functions of nm23 proteins .",O O B I O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Native human erythrocyte NDP kinase protein inhibited the induction of erythroid differentiation of HEL , KU812 and K562 cells , but not the induction of monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL - 60 , U937 and HEL / S cells .",B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The erythroid differentiation of HEL cells was inhibited by recombinant human nm23 - H1 , - H2 , mouse nm23 - M1 , and - M2 proteins .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O
"Moreover , both the mutant nm23 - H2His protein and truncated nm23 - H2 protein containing N - terminal ( 1 - 60 ) peptide , which do not have NDP kinase activity , also inhibited erythroid differentiation of HEL cells .",O O O O B I I I I O B I I I I O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
"These results suggest that ( 1 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of I - factor / nm23 protein is not restricted to monocytic differentiation of M1 cells , ( 2 ) the inhibitory activity is exhibited without species specificity , and ( 3 ) the differentiation inhibitory activity of the nm23 / NDP kinase protein is independent of its enzyme activity and requires the presence of N - terminal peptides .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lipopolysaccharide - induced E - selectin expression requires continuous presence of LPS and is inhibited by bactericidal / permeability - increasing protein .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
"Endothelial cells stimulated by LPS express E - selectin , which plays an important role in mediating neutrophil adhesion during inflammation .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"rBPI21 , a recombinant N - terminal fragment of human bactericidal / permeability - increasing protein ( BPI ) , inhibited LPS - induced E - selectin expression when added at the same time as , and up to 6 h after , LPS .",B O O B I I I I O B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These results indicate that endothelial activation requires continuous presence of LPS , and rBPI21 acts to reverse LPS - mediated endothelial activation by interrupting the on - going LPS signal .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"So called costimulatory signals , mediated by other cell surface interactions or soluble cytokines produced by antigen presenting cells , are also required for complete T cell activation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
High levels of cytokine gene expression in T cells also required both TCR and costimulatory signals .,O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor requires sequences in the promoter as well as a powerful enhancer located 3kb upstream to respond to TCR - like signals .,O B I I I I I I O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O
These promoter and enhancer regions are mainly activated by the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .,O B I I I O O O O O B I I I I I I I O B O O
The activation of NFAT by TCR signals has been well described for interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) and IL - 4 gene transcription in T cells .,O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
This region is termed the CK - 1 or CD28RE and appears to bind specific members of the NF - kappa B family of transcription factors .,O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I O
"We have found that the HTLV - 1 transactivator protein , tax , acts as a costimulatory signal for GM - CSF and IL - 2 gene transcription , in that it can cooperate with TCR signals to mediate high level gene expression .",O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Tax activates the GM - CSF promoter through the CK - 1 / CD28RE region and also activates nuclear factor - kappa B binding to this region .,O O O B I I I O O B I I B I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O
"However , other transcription factors or coactivators of NF - kappa B are required for tax activation but these remain to be identified .",O O O B I O O O B I I I O O O B O O O O O O O O
The CK - 1 / CD28RE of GM - CSF shows a high degree of similarity to the IL - 2 CD28RE and the IL - 3 gene also contains a related region .,O B I I B I O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I B O O B I I I O O O O O O

"Using a cell line that is stably transfected with a trimer of the NFAT - 1 regulatory element linked to a lac - Z reporter gene , we screened for inhibitors of NFAT - 1 - mediated beta - galactosidase activity .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O O
WIN 61058 and WIN 53071 were identified as microM inhibitors .,O O O O O O O O O O O

"Expression of the protooncogene c - fos is controlled by three main regulatory pathways involving kinase C , cAMP , and calcium .",O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
Kinase C mediates its effects via phosphorylation of serum response factor ( SRF ) which interacts with the serum response element ( SRE ) ; cAMP and calcium mediate their effects via phosphorylation of CREB ( cAMP regulatory element binding protein ) presumably by activation of a protein kinase A or calmodulin - regulated kinase .,B I O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O
We have found that stimulation of any one of these pathways alone has little or no effect on c - fos induction .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"However , kinase C activation ( PMA stimulation ) combined with either cAMP ( forskolin plus MIX ) or calcium stimulation ( ionophore ) leads to greatly enhanced c - fos induction .",O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"By contrast , cAMP in the presence of calcium shows no synergy in c - fos induction .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
Analysis of AP - 1 activity using gel mobility shift assays confirms that the requirements for synergy in c - fos mRNA induction are paralleled by requirements for synergy in induction of AP - 1 activity .,O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Signaling in B cells due to anti - Ig stimulation involves both kinase C activation and release of intracellular calcium , and results in c - fos mRNA induction .",O O O O O O B I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O

That synergy of signaling pathways is relevant for the anti - Ig induction of c - fos is supported by the fact that cAMP - inducing agents and okadaic acid further enhance anti - Ig induction of c - fos .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O

Abnormal regulation of the IL - 2 promoter in lpr CD4 - CD8 - T lymphocytes results in constitutive expression of a novel nuclear factor of activated T cells - binding factor .,O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O
The inert quality of MRL - Ipr / Ipr ( Ipr ) peripheral CD4 - CD8 - ( CD4 - 8 - ) T cells manifests primarily as an inability to proliferate or produce IL - 2 in response to TCR or mitogenic stimulation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O O O
"Yet these same cells do initiate early TCR - mediated signaling events , such as generation of inositol phosphates and increased intracellular calcium .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We , therefore , compared the activation state of the IL - 2 gene promoter region in freshly isolated and stimulated Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells with that of normal T lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Upon stimulation with mitogens , formation of the transactivating complex , nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT ) , occurs with normal kinetics in Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Yet , the levels of the activating NF - AT complex never reach those observed in similarly stimulated normal T cells .",O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , nuclear extracts from Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells display high levels of a novel specific binding activity at the NF - AT site , which is present at much lower levels in freshly isolated normal T lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Upon mitogenic stimulation , the binding activity of the novel NF - AT - binding factor is rapidly down - regulated in normal T cells , but persists at high levels in Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These two abnormalities at the NF - AT site provide a potential mechanism to account for the defect in IL - 2 production from Ipr CD4 - 8 - T cells .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
Cross - linking of CD30 induces HIV expression in chronically infected T cells .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"CD30 , a member of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptor family , is expressed constitutively on the surface of the human T cell line ACH - 2 , which is chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type - 1 ( HIV ) - 1 .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CD30 cross - linking does not alter proliferation of ACH - 2 cells and the induction of HIV expression is not mediated by endogenous TNF alpha / beta .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Furthermore , cross - linking of CD30 leads to NF - kappa B activation and enhanced HIV transcription .",O O O O O O B O O B I I I O O O O O O
"Thus , CD30 - CD30L interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a kappa B - dependent pathway that is independent of TNF .",O O B B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"This mechanism may be important in the activation of HIV expression from latently infected CD4 + T cells , especially in lymphoid organs where cell to cell contact is conducive to receptor - ligand interactions .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Recently , the defective gene in group II type II MHC CID has been isolated and termed CIITA .",O O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O B O
"The specificity of CIITA for three major MHC class II genes , DR , DQ and DP , is mediated by its remaining C - terminal residues ( amino acids 317 - 1130 ) .",O O O B O O O B I I I O B O B O B O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I I O O
"The transactivation of multiple cis elements , especially S and X2 , of the DR alpha proximal promoter in group II CID cells is CIITA dependent .",O O O B I I O O B O B O O O B I I I O O O O O O B O O
"Since CIITA overexpression in normal cells did not increase class II expression , we propose that initiation of CIITA expression serves as the on - off switch , while availability of downstream interactor ( s ) limits transcription .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Adhesion of human monocytes to P - selectin , the most rapidly expressed endothelial tethering factor , increased the secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) by the leukocytes when they were stimulated with platelet - activating factor .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O O B I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O

Erythroid lineage and developmental stage specificities .,O O O O O O O
"Transcriptional regulation of the human alpha - like globin genes , embryonic zeta 2 and adult alpha , during erythroid development is mediated by a distal enhancer , HS - 40 .",O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O B I O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O
Previous protein - DNA binding studies have shown that HS - 40 consists of multiple nuclear factor binding motifs that are occupied in vivo in an erythroid lineage - and developmental stage - specific manner .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have systematically analyzed the functional roles of these factor binding motifs of HS - 40 by site - directed mutagenesis and transient expression assay in erythroid cell cultures .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Three of these HS - 40 enhancer motifs , 5 ' NF - E2 / AP1 , GT II , and GATA - 1 ( c ) , positively regulate the zeta 2 - globin promoter activity in embryonic / fetal erythroid K562 cells and the adult alpha - globin promoter activity in adult erythroid MEL cells .",O O O B I I I I O B I I I I I I O B I O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O
"On the other hand , the 3 ' NF - E2 / AP1 motif is able to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on the zeta 2 - globin promoter activity in K562 cells , and this dual function appears to be modulated through differential binding of the ubiquitous AP1 factors and the erythroid - enriched NF - E2 factor .",O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I O
"Mutation in the GATA - 1 ( d ) motif , which exhibits an adult erythroid - specific genomic footprint , decreases the HS - 40 enhancer function in dimethyl sulfoxide - induced MEL cells but not in K562 cells .",O O O B I I I I I I O O O O B I I I I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These studies have defined the regulatory roles of the different HS - 40 motifs .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
The remarkable correlation between genomic footprinting data and the mutagenesis results also suggests that the erythroid lineage - and developmental stage - specific regulation of human alpha - like globin promoters is indeed modulated by stable binding of specific nuclear factors in vivo .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O

"The regulation of interleukin ( IL ) - 2 gene expression has been investigated mainly in T lymphocytes , the predominant producers of IL - 2 .",O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"However , B cells can also synthesize IL - 2 .",O O O O O O O B I I O
"An IL - 2 promoter bearing a defective NF - chi B site was completely inactive in EBV - transformed B cells , while it still had activity in Jurkat T cells .",O B I I I O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Similarly , a human immunodeficiency virus promoter , whose activity is controlled through chi B factors , was found to be active in the IL - 2 producing EBV - B cells , but inactive in the non - IL - 2 - producing cells .",O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using protein extracts from EBV - B cells and the IL - 2 NF - chi B probe revealed the constitutive generation of chi B complexes in IL - 2 - secreting cells consisting mainly of heterodimeric p50 / p65 complexes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
A weaker chi B complex formation and faster - migrating complexes were detected in non - IL - 2 - secreting cells .,O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These results demonstrate that the IL - 2 NF - chi B site is indispensable for the activity of the IL - 2 promoter in EBV - transformed B cells , whereas other transcription factors appear to be less important for IL - 2 expression in these cells .",O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O

"Chemical cross - linking with 125I - labeled TGF - beta 1 showed an essentially normal TGF - beta receptor profile in EBV - positive and EBV - negative Burkitt ' s lymphoma cell lines , and these receptors were shown to be functional in transducing signals , as evidenced by the TGF - beta 1 - mediated modulation of junB gene expression .",O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I O O
"However , TGF - beta 1 did not induce dephosphorylation of pRb in EBV ( or LMP - 1 ) - positive cells as opposed to EBV - negative cells , suggesting a dichotomy in the TGF - beta 1 signaling pathway leading to separable gene regulatory and growth inhibitory responses .",O O B I I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

Insertion of oligonucleotides spanning the DQB X - box ( but not the DQB - W region or the DQB Y - box ) upstream of - 141 in a DRA reporter plasmid rescued expression to nearly wild - type levels .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O B I I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Substitution promoters were then generated where the entire X - box , or only the X1 - or X2 - boxes of HLA - DRA were replaced with the analogous regions of HLA - DQB .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O
"None of the hybrid reporter constructs were defective when transfected into the wild - type , HLA - DR / - DQ positive parental cell line , Jijoye .",O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Restoration of the Epstein - Barr virus ZEBRA protein ' s capacity to disrupt latency by the addition of heterologous activation regions .,O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
The ZEBRA protein has a unique biological function among herpesviral proteins .,O B I O O O O O O B I O
It is responsible for the disruption of Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) latency and the induction of the lytic cycle .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have employed the ZEBRA / EBV biological system to test whether a heterologous activation domain can substitute for another activation domain ( the ZEBRA domain ) .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I O O
The ZEBRA activation region was replaced with the potent acid activation region from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein or with the activation region of the EBV R protein .,O B I I O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I O O O B I O O B I I O
"Activation was not target - or cell - type dependent , nor was it dependent on the presence of virus .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These studies suggest that the specificities of some of the known biological functions of ZEBRA are not dependent upon the nature of the activation domain present within ZEBRA .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O B O
Interleukin 4 activates a signal transducer and activator of transcription ( Stat ) protein which interacts with an interferon - gamma activation site - like sequence upstream of the I epsilon exon in a human B cell line .,B I O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O

"Germ line C transcripts can be induced by IL - 4 in the human B cell line , BL - 2 .",B I I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Utilizing a IFN - gamma activation site - like DNA sequence element located upstream of the I epsilon exon , we demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays that IL - 4 induced a binding activity in the cytosol and nucleus of BL - 2 cells .",O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This factor was designated IL - 4 NAF ( IL - 4 - induced nuclear - activating factors ) and was identified as a tyrosine phosphoprotein , which translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus upon IL - 4 treatment .",O O O O B I I I O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Congruous with the involvement of a Stat protein , IL - 4 induced robust Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) activity in BL - 2 cells .",O O O O O O B I O B I I O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O
Cotransfection of JAK3 with IL - 4 Stat into COS - 7 cells produced an intracellular activity which bound the same IFN - gamma activation site - like sequence and comigrated with IL - 4 NAF in electrophoretic mobility shift assay .,O O B O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O

Does activation of the TAL1 gene occur in a majority of patients with T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ? A pediatric oncology group study .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Almost 25 % of patients with T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T - ALL ) have tumor - specific rearrangements of the TAL1 gene .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Although TAL1 expression has not been observed in normal lymphocytes , TAL1 gene products are readily detected in leukemic cells that harbor a rearranged TAL1 allele .",O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Hence , it has been proposed that ectopic expression of TAL1 promotes the development of T - ALL .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"In this report , we show that TAL1 is expressed in the leukemic cells of most patients with T - ALL , including many that do not display an apparent TAL1 gene alteration .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
A polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the transcribed sequences of TAL1 was used to determine the allele specificity of TAL1 transcription in primary T - ALL cells .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"Thus , TAL1 activation in these patients may result from subtle alterations in cis - acting regulatory sequences ( affecting expression of a single TAL1 allele ) or changes in trans - acting factors that control TAL1 transcription ( affecting expression of both TAL1 alleles ) .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I O O

Expression of Ah receptor ( TCDD receptor ) during human monocytic differentiation .,O O B I O B I O O O O O O
We have previously found a high expression of human Ah receptor ( TCDD receptor ) mRNA in peripheral blood cells of individuals .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O
Then the expression levels of AhR mRNA in various hematopoietic cell lines were examined together with those of Arnt and P450IA1 .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
"AhR was expressed at high levels in monocytoid U937 , THP1 , and HEL / S cells , and at moderate levels in promyelocytic HL60 cells and erythroblastic HEL cells .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , it was not detected in lymphoid cells MOLT4 ( T cell ) and BALL1 ( B cell ) , nor in K562 erythroblasts .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , a specific induction of AhR during monocytic differentiation was investigated in HL60 and HEL cells .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
"HL60 cells were induced to differentiate toward monocytes - macrophages by incubation with phorbol ester , showing a 5 - to 2 - fold increase of AhR mRNA .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"The HEL cells also exhibited a similar elevation of AhR mRNA level , when they had differentiated toward monocyte - macrophage cells by these combined inducers , but little change in the mRNA level was observed when the cells were induced to differentiate into other cell types .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Treatment of the differentiated HL60 cells with 3 - methylcholanthrene , a ligand of AhR , induced the expression of the P450IA1 gene .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O
These results indicated that expression of AhR mRNA was significantly induced during monocytic differentiation and that the differentiated cells were responsive to xenobiotics .,O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results suggest that AhR may play an important role in the function of monocytes and also in the eventual activation of environmental carcinogens .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neutrophils and monocytes express high levels of PU . 1 ( Spi - 1 ) but not Spi - B .,O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O B I I O
"PU . 1 ( the Spi - 1 oncogene ) and Spi - B are closely related members of the ets transcription factor family , sharing similar DNA binding specificities mediated by similar DNA binding domains .",B I I O O B I I I O O B I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"PU . 1 and Spi - B have been previously described as being predominantly expressed coordinately in macrophages and B cells , but their expression in early hematopoietic stages and during the course of myeloid differentiation to monocytes and macrophages or to neutrophils has not been extensively investigated .",B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Here , we report that PU . 1 mRNA is upregulated during myeloid differentiation of human purified CD34 + cells and murine multipotential FDCP - mix A4 cells , suggesting that PU . 1 is upregulated as an early event during differentiation of multipotential progenitor cells .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PU . 1 expression is maintained at stable levels during differentiation of myeloid cell lines U937 and HL - 60 to monocytic and neutrophilic cells .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PU . 1 is expressed at highest levels in mature human monocytes and human peripheral blood neutrophils .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast to PU . 1 , significant levels of Spi - B mRNA and protein are found only in some B - cell lines and spleen but are not found in myeloid cell lines , neutrophils , or macrophages .",O O O B I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Therefore , although PU . 1 and Spi - B may bind to similar DNA control elements and have redundancy of transactivation function in vitro , the lack of significant levels of Spi - B in myeloid cells makes it unlikely that Spi - B plays a significant role in myeloid lineage development and gene expression .",O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Identification of a major positive regulatory element located 5 ' to the human zeta - globin gene .,O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I I O
The function of the zeta - globin promoter was studied using a series of zeta - globin promoter deletion constructs to drive luciferase expression in transiently transfected human erythroleukemia cells .,O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I O O B O O O O O O O O
"When the constructs were transfected into OCIM1 cells , which do not express zeta - globin , the zeta - globin promoters were at best 20 % as active as the alpha - globin promoters .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"When sequences from - 417 to - 207 5 ' to the zeta - globin mRNA cap site were deleted , up to 95 % of the zeta - globin promoter activity was lost in K562 cells .",O B I I I I I I I I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
Reinsertion of these sequences into zeta - luciferase constructs missing the - 417 to - 207 region showed that the sequences lack classical enhancer activity .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Point mutation of a GATA - 1 site at - 230 reduced promoter activity by 37 % .,O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
Point mutation of a CCACC site at - 240 had no effect .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O

"PKC - epsilon , but not PKC - alpha nor activated p21ras , was able to induce NF - KB activity .",B I I O O O B I I O O B O O O O O B I I O O
Phorbol esters induce expression of CD69 whereas none of the activated PKC isotypes tested were able to have this effect .,O O O O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O

"Although glucocorticosteroids are a very effective treatment for asthma and other chronic inflammatory diseases , a small proportion of patients are resistant to their therapeutic effects .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The molecular mechanism for this steroid resistance is unclear .,O O O O O O O O O O
"Steroid resistance can not be explained by pharmacokinetic mechanisms , by a defect in the binding of steroids to glucocorticoid receptors , nor by defective nuclear translocation of this receptor , thereby suggesting that the molecular abnormality lies distal to nuclear translocation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to DNA in these patients was also studied using Scatchard analysis .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Dexamethasone induced a significant rapid and sustained twofold increase in GRE binding in PBMCs from steroid - sensitive asthmatic patients and nonasthmatic individuals , but this was markedly reduced in steroid - resistant asthmatic patients .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor to bind to GRE is impaired in steroid - resistant patients because of a reduced number of receptors available for binding to DNA .,O O O O O O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O

Infection and replication of Tat - human immunodeficiency viruses : genetic analyses of LTR and tat mutations in primary and long - term human lymphoid cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Tat is an essential regulatory protein for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .,B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
Mutations in the tat gene have been shown to block HIV replication in human T cells .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Several studies have established that Tat releases an elongation block to the transcription of HIV long terminal repeat ( LTR ) ; however , it is not known whether this mechanism alone is sufficient to explain the block to HIV replication in human T cells when Tat is absent .",O O O O O B O O B I O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O

Large amounts of viral RNA and particles were synthesized in infections established using the tat mutants that contain modified LTRs .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O

"The interaction of the transcription factors , activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF kappa B ) , and cAMP - responsive element binding protein ( CREB ) with DNA and glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by gel mobility shift assays .",O O O O B I O B I I I O B I I O O B I I I O B I I O O O B I I I I I O B O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Dexamethasone produced a rapid and sustained increase in glucocorticoid response element binding and a concomitant 40 - 50 % decrease in AP - 1 , NF kappa B , and CREB DNA binding that was blocked by combined dexamethasone and cytokine or PMA treatment .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
"These latter effects were due to increases in the nuclear localization of GR , not to reduced amounts of the other transcription factors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I O

Stimulation of human CD4 + T - cell clones through the T - cell receptor ( TcR ) by high doses of specific peptide results in the induction of a long - lived state of nonresponsiveness that has been called anergy .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The amount of TcR at the cell surface is downmodulated , whereas the CD2 and CD25 receptors are increased .",O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O

The number of glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral human lymphocytes is elevated by a zinc containing trace element preparation .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A trace element preparation ( Beres Drops Plus , BDP ) elevates the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( gcR ) in peripheral lymphocytes isolated both from healthy blood donors and rheumatoid arthritis patients .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This enhancement by BDP was found either for constitutive expression of gcRs or in experiments when the lymphocytes were stimulated by interleukin ( IL ) - 6 .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
There was no significant effect of BDP on IL - 1 and tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) - induced changes of gcRs .,O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O B I O O O O O B O
The DNA and steroid binding domains of the glucocorticoid receptor are not altered in mononuclear cells of treated CLL patients .,O O O B I I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of this study was to investigate whether mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor could account for the increasing unresponsiveness of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia ( CLL ) to combination chemotherapy .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The receptor was tested immunocytochemically , in steroid binding assays , and by a mutation screening ( denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ) of the receptor - cDNA .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
In one individual who had not been treated before analysis a silent mutation was found in one receptor allele .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results suggest that mechanisms other than altered ligand or DNA binding of the receptor may be responsible for the lack of response to chemotherapy .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This conclusion is discussed in relation to the mechanism of corticoid resistance in mouse and human lymphoma cells in culture .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An AP1 binding site upstream of the kappa immunoglobulin intron enhancer binds inducible factors and contributes to expression .,O B I I O O O B I I I O B I O O O O O
"A new protein - DNA interaction has been identified upstream of the intron enhancer , within the matrix - associated region of the J - C intron .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I I O O B I I I O
The binding activity is greatly inducible in pre - B cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interleukin - 1 but specific complexes are found at all stages of B cell development tested .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The footprinted binding site is homologous to the consensus AP1 motif .,O B I I O O O O B I I O
"The protein components of this complex are specifically competed by an AP1 consensus motif and were shown by supershift to include c - Jun and c - Fos , suggesting that this binding site is an AP1 motif and that the Jun and Fos families of transcription factors play a role in the regulation of the kappa light chain gene .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O B I O O B I O O O B I I I O B I O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Mutation of the AP1 motif in the context of the intron enhancer was shown to decrease enhancer - mediated activation of the promoter in both pre - B cells induced with LPS and constitutive expression in mature B cells .,O O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Distinct DNase - I hypersensitive sites are associated with TAL - 1 transcription in erythroid and T - cell lines .,O B I I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"The tal - 1 gene , frequently activated in human T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T - ALL ) , is expressed in the erythroid , megakaryocytic , and mast cell lineages during normal hematopoiesis .",O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that control tal - 1 expression , we investigated tal - 1 chromatin structure in erythroid / megakaryocytic cell lines and in T - cell lines either with or without tal - 1 rearrangements .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Tal - 1 transcription was shown to be monoallelic in Jurkat , a T - cell line that expresses tal - 1 in the absence of apparent genomic alteration of the locus .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Five major DNase - I hypersensitive sites ( HS ) were mapped in the tal - 1 locus .,O O B I I I I O B O O O O O B I I O O
"HS I , IV , and V were exclusively observed in the erythroid / megakaryocytic cell lines that express tal - 1 from the promoters 1a and 1b .",B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O
"HS II was weak in hematopoietic cell lines , absent in Hela , and greatly enhanced in Jurkat , suggesting that this region might be implicated in the cis - activation of tal - 1 promoter 1b in this cell line .",B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O
"HS III was weak in HEL and Jurkat , and greatly enhanced in DU528 , a T - cell line that bears a t ( 1 ; 14 ) and initiates tal - 1 transcription within exon 4 .",B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O B I I O O B I O
These results suggest that distinct regulatory elements are associated with the use of the different tal - 1 promoters .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Erythropoietin - dependent induction of hemoglobin synthesis in a cytokine - dependent cell line M - TAT .,B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We cultured M - TAT cells long term ( > 1 year ) in the continuous presence of erythropoietin ( EPO ) , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) , or stem cell factor ( SCF ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B I I I I I I O B I I O O O B I I O B O O
"These long term cultures are referred to as M - TAT / EPO , M - TAT / GM - CSF , and M - TAT / SCF cells , respectively .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hemoglobin concentration and gamma - globin and erythroid delta - aminolevulinate synthase mRNA levels were significantly higher in M - TAT / EPO cells than in M - TAT / GM - CSF cells .,B O O B I I O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"When the supplemented cytokine was switched from GM - CSF to EPO , hemoglobin synthesis in M - TAT / GM - CSF cells increased rapidly ( within 5 h ) , and the level of GATA - 1 mRNA increased .",O O O B O O O B I I O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
"Thus , erythroid development of M - TAT cells is promoted by EPO and suppressed by GM - CSF .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O
These results support the hypothesis that EPO actively influences the programming of gene expression required for erythroid progenitor cell differentiation .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The role of cellular transcription factor E2F in the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression and cell cycle control of human hematopoietic cells .,O O O B I I I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
cdc2 mRNA transcripts were detected in immature bone marrow cells and became undetectable along with differentiation .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Peripheral blood resting cells did not express cdc2 mRNA , but it was induced in T - lymphocytes when the cells reentered the cell cycle in response to specific mitogens .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , cdc2 mRNA could not be induced in granulocytes and monocytes even after the culture with the appropriate stimulants .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In order to investigate the mechanism of the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression in hematopoietic cells , we isolated the 5 ' - flanking sequence of the cdc2 gene and found the putative E2F binding site at the position of nucleotides - 124 to - 117 .",O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O B I I I I I O
"The binding of E2F at this region was detected by a gel - retardation assay and DNaseI footprinting in phytohemagglutinin - stimulated T - lymphocytes , which was coincident with the expression of cdc2 mRNA .",O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
E2F binding was not observed in both granulocytes and monocytes .,B O O O O O O O O O O
"The induction of E2F activity preceded the appearance of cdc2 mRNA , which is consistent with the role of E2F in the regulation of cdc2 mRNA expression .",O O O B O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that cdc2 mRNA expression is related to the cell cycling of normal human hematopoietic cells and that E2F plays some roles in the regulation of its expression .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O

Molecular mechanisms leading to restricted HIV - 1 replication may differ between certain cell types .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"It is now demonstrated that HIV - 1 proviral latency in the monocytic cell line U1 , in which only extremely low levels of HIV - 1 expression are detected in the baseline unstimulated state , is associated with alterations in nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) moieties demonstrated in these cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) and in situ UV cross - linking studies .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A predominance of p50 NF - kappa B moieties and possibly p50 homodimers or closely related species , rather than the p50 - p56 heterodimer of NF - kappa B that is the predominant NF - kappa B species in most T lymphocytic and monocytic cells , is demonstrated in the nuclei of U1 cells .",O O O B I I I I I O O B I O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

[ Regulation of transcription of the interleukin - 2 gene in B - lymphocytes ],O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
"Since most B cell clones immortalized with EBV virus can be induced to produce interleukin - 2 , a typical T cell cytokine , we studied the role of different elements of the IL - 2 promoter in such clones by transfection .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O

"First , we show that persistent HIV infection results in the activation of NF - kappa B not only in monocytic cells but also in macrophages .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In HIV - infected cells , I kappa B alpha protein levels are decreased secondary to enhanced protein degradation .",O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O

"Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes , which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids in various diseases including leukemia , depends on the glucocorticoid receptor .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"However , the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are not understood .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A prevailing hypothesis postulates induction of so - called ' lysis genes ' by the activated receptor .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I O

T cells from renal cell carcinoma patients exhibit an abnormal pattern of kappa B - specific DNA - binding activity : a preliminary report .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recent data suggest that the poor induction of a T - cell response to human renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) may be related to alterations in signal transduction pathways .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report that T cells from RCC patients have two alterations in kappa B motif - specific DNA - binding activity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The first alteration involves the constitutive expression of substantial kappa B - binding activity in nuclear extracts , which was observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The magnitude of kappa B activity in unstimulated patient T cells was similar to that observed in T cells from normal individuals that had been activated in vitro .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"On the basis of Western blotting experiments using antibodies to kappa B / Rel family proteins , the kappa B - binding activity constitutively expressed in T cells from RCC patients is composed mostly of the NF - kappa B1 ( p50 ) subunit .",O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O
Western blotting analysis did not detect any RelA in nuclear extracts either before or after stimulation of T cells .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Hemoglobin switching in humans is accompanied by changes in the ratio of the transcription factors , GATA - 1 and SP1 .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O B O
BACKGROUND : Understanding the mechanism of developmental regulation of hemoglobin switching has scientific as well as clinical relevance because of the influence of fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) production in adulthood on the clinical manifestation of thalassemia and sickle cell anemia .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have previously found that the normal developmental patterns of globin gene expression are recapitulated in an experimental system of primary cultures that support differentiation of erythroid progenitors .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We further found that high activities of the transcriptional activators , GATA - 1 and SP1 , are associated with normal adult erythroid differentiation .",O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O
"MATERIALS AND METHODS : In the present work , we have studied , the activities of GATA - 1 and SP1 during differentiation of cultured erythroid progenitors derived from cord blood and from fetal livers , as well as from beta zero - thalassemia patients .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS : The results showed high GATA - 1 binding activity and very low SP1 activity in the fetal liver cultures .,O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O
"This pattern was in contrast to cultures derived from normal adult peripheral blood , in which both GATA - 1 and SP1 activities were high .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O
The progenitors derived from a beta zero - thalassemia patient with high HbF production showed ` ` fetal ' ' pattern .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"On the other hand , in cultures of 2 beta zero - thalassemia patients without high HbF , ` ` adult ' ' pattern was observed .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
"CONCLUSIONS : In the present work , we show that human fetal and adult erythroid progenitors are distinct in their transcription factors , and that the commitment to fetal or adult program occurs at a very early differentiation stage .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Transcription - independent turnover of I kappa B alpha during monocyte adherence : implications for a translational component regulating I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA levels .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O
"We identified I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 as an immediate - early gene in human monocytes that is expressed in response to a variety of signals , including adhesion , lipopolysaccharide , and phorbol myristate acetate .",O O B I I I I I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Within 5 min of monocyte adhesion , the level of the I kappa B alpha protein is markedly diminished but is rapidly replaced in a cycloheximide - sensitive manner within 20 min .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Accompanying the rapid turnover of the I kappa B alpha protein is simultaneous translocation of NF - kappa B - related transcription factors to nuclei of adhered monocytes .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O
The demonstration that NF - kappa B can regulate I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene transcription in other cell types suggested that the rapid increase in steady - state I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA levels we observed within 30 min of monocyte adherence would result from NF - kappa B - dependent transcriptional stimulation of the I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene .,O O O B I I I O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O
"Nuclear run - on analyses indicated that , instead , while several immediate - early cytokine genes , such as the interleukin 1 beta ( IL - 1 beta ) gene , were transcriptionally activated during monocyte adhesion , the rate of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene transcription remained constant .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O
The adherence - dependent increase in I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA levels was also not a consequence of mRNA stabilization events .,O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B O O O
"Interestingly , while increases in both IL - 1 beta and I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA levels were detected in nuclei of adherent monocytes , cytoplasmic levels of IL - 1 beta mRNA increased during adherence whereas those of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA did not .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O
"We propose that adherent monocytes regulate nuclear processing ( or decay ) of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA , thereby increasing mRNA levels without stimulating I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene transcription .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O
"Moreover , since inhibition of protein synthesis leads to accumulation of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA without stimulating I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 gene transcription , we suggest that low cytoplasmic levels of I kappa B alpha / MAD - 3 mRNA are maintained by a translation - dependent degradation mechanism .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
Distinct roles of the molecular chaperone hsp90 in modulating dioxin receptor function via the basic helix - loop - helix and PAS domains .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I O
The intracellular dioxin receptor mediates signal transduction by dioxin and functions as a ligand - activated transcription factor .,O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
It contains a basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) motif contiguous with a Per - Arnt - Sim ( PAS ) homology region .,O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O B I I I I I I I I I O
We have reconstituted ligand - dependent activation of the receptor to a DNA - binding form by using the dioxin receptor and its bHLH - PAS partner factor Arnt expressed by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I O O B I I I I B O O O O O O O O O
Deletion of the PAS domain of the receptor resulted in constitutive dimerization with Arnt .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O B O
"In contrast , this receptor mutant showed low levels of xenobiotic response element - binding activity , indicating that the PAS domain may be important for DNA - binding affinity and / or specificity of the receptor .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"At least two distinct domains of the receptor mediated interaction with hsp90 : the ligand - binding domain located within the PAS region and , surprisingly , the bHLH domain .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I O O O B I O O O O O B I O
"Whereas ligand - binding activity correlated with association with hsp90 , bHLH - hsp90 interaction appeared to be important for DNA - binding activity but not for dimerization of the receptor .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Several distinct roles for hsp90 in modulating dioxin receptor function are therefore likely : correct folding of the ligand - binding domain , interference with Arnt heterodimerization , and folding of a DNA - binding conformation of the bHLH domain .",O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Thus , the dioxin receptor system provides a complex and interesting model of the regulation of transcription factors by hsp90 .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O
"Aspirin - like drugs ( ALD ) induce calcium mobilization , an essential component of T cell activation , but do not induce the biosynthesis of IL - 2 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"To understand the extent to which ALD may mimic mitogenic stimulation , we studied cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling steps in ALD - treated T cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found that ALD induce a transient activation of protein kinase ( PKC ) but have no effect ( in comparison to anti - CD3 antibodies ) on protein tyrosine phosphorylation nor on PCL gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation .,O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"ALD - induced calcium mobilization and PKC activation are independent of tyrosine protein kinase activity as shown by the lack of effect of herbimycin , a tyrosine - protein kinase - specific inhibitor .",O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
"Although we detected no IL - 2 mRNA in ALD - treated cells , the nuclei of these cells contain proteins capable of binding to three regulatory sequences in the IL - 2 promoter region : NFAT , NF kappa B , and AP - 1 .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I I O B O B I I O O B I I O
These binding activities are expressed only in activated T cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O
The expression of AP - 1 depended on calcium mobilization and PKC activation .,O O O B I I O O O O O B O O
"These data suggest that ALD cause transient but significant changes in T cell transmembrane signaling , although some events induced by stimulation with anti - CD3 antibodies are not induced by ALD .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O
The signal is transmitted to the nucleus and induces DNA - binding activity by several transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"However , the ALD stimulus is not capable of causing complete T cell activation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The aim of this present study was to investigate the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , downstream of p21ras , in activating interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) gene expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O B O O O B I I I I I I I I O O
It has been reported that PKC is an effector of p21ras in T cells .,O O O O O B O O B O B O O O O

The C - terminus of the B cell activator Oct - 2 functions as an activation domain in yeast .,O B I I O O B I I B I I O O O B I O O O
Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 are human transcriptional activators that bind to the same DNA element but activate distinct sets of genes .,B I I O B I I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We expressed these factors in S . cerevisiae and observed greater than 5 - fold stimulation of a lacZ reporter gene only with Oct - 2 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O
"Transfer of the Oct - 2 C - terminal domain onto either Oct - 1 ( Oct1 . 2 ) or a nonactivating DNA - binding domain from GAL4 created activators capable of greater than 15 and 10 - fold stimulation of activity , respectively .",O O O B I I I I I I O O B I I O B I I O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Interleukin - 2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of stat3 in human T lymphocytes .,B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O
An early biochemical event associated with T cell activation through the interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) is tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O
The exact mechanism by which IL - 2 regulates transcription of different genes is presently unknown .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O

( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ),O O O O O O O
Activation of NF - kappa B in vivo is regulated by multiple phosphorylations .,O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
The activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) in intact cells is mechanistically not well understood .,O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"In HeLa cells as well as in B cells , TNF - alpha rapidly induced nuclear translocation primarily of p50 - p65 , but not of c - rel .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O
Both NF - kappa B precursors and I kappa B alpha became strongly phosphorylated with the same kinetics .,O B I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
"In addition to the inducible phosphorylation after stimulation , B lymphocytes containing constitutive nuclear NF - kappa B revealed constitutively phosphorylated p65 and I kappa B alpha .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B O B I I I O
Phosphorylation was accompanied by induced processing of the precursors p100 and p105 and by degradation of I kappa B alpha .,O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O B I I I O
"As an in vitro model we show that phosphorylation of p105 impedes its ability to interact with NF - kappa B , as has been shown before for I kappa B alpha .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Surprisingly , even p65 , but not c - rel , was phosphorylated after induction in vivo , suggesting that TNF - alpha selectively activates only specific NF - kappa B heteromers and that modifications regulate not only I kappa B molecules but also NF - kappa B molecules .",O O O B O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O O
"In fact , cellular NF - kappa B activity was phosphorylation - dependent and the DNA binding activity of p65 - containing NF - kappa B was enhanced by phosphorylation in vitro .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , we found that the induction by hydrogen peroxide of NF - kappa B translocation to the nucleus , which is assumed to be triggered by reactive oxygen intermediates , also coincided with incorporation of phosphate into the same subunits that were modified after stimulation by TNF - alpha .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

We include a redox - regulatory mechanism ( s ) in this common pathway to account for the previously demonstrated redox regulation of NF - kappa B activation in Jurkat cells ( in which oxidants do n ' t activate NF - kappa B ) ; we put tyrosine phosphorylation in the common pathway by showing that kinase activity ( inhibitable by herbimycin A and tyrphostin 47 ) is required for NF - kappa B activation by all stimuli tested in both cell lines .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Since internal sites of oxidant production have been shown to play a key role in the cytokine - stimulated activation of NF - kappa B , and since tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities are known to be altered by oxidants , these findings suggest that intracellular redox status controls NF - kappa B activation by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation event ( s ) within the common step of the NF - kappa B signal transduction pathway .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O

"EBV nuclear antigen 2 ( EBNA2 ) , one of the first genes expressed after EBV infection of B - cells , is a transcriptional activator of viral and cellular genes and is essential for the transforming potential of the virus .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Growth transformation of primary normal B - cells by mutant virus resulted in estrogen - dependent lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing the chimeric EBNA2 protein .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
In the absence of estrogen about half of the cells enter a quiescent non - proliferative state whereas the others die by apoptosis .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
EBNA2 is thus required not only for initiation but also for maintenance of transformation .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Growth arrest occurred at G1 and G2 stages of the cell cycle , indicating that functional EBNA2 is required at different restriction points of the cell cycle .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O

IL - 1 receptor and TCR signals synergize to activate NF - kappa B - mediated gene transcription .,B I I I O B O O O O B I I I O O O O O
Previous studies have demonstrated that IL - 1 receptor ( IL - 1R ) - and TCR - initiated signals can interact synergistically to increase the rate of transcription of several lymphokine and lymphokine receptor genes during the competence phase of the activation program in T helper lymphocytes .,O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this report we describe how signals initiated through the type I IL - 1R interact with signals from the antigen receptor to synergistically augment the transactivating properties of NF - kappa B .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Gel shift analyses demonstrate that NF - kappa B nuclear translocation is stimulated primarily by IL - 1 rather than by antigen receptor signals .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O B I O O
Western blot and phosphorylation analyses demonstrate that the synergistic effect on NF - kappa B functional activity is independent of I kappa B alpha ( MAD3 ) - NF - kappa B dissociation in the cytosol and is not associated with I kappa B nuclear translocation .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I O B O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
These results suggest that IL - 1 induces both NF - kappa B nuclear translocation and the synthesis of a protein ( s ) responsible for terminating NF - kappa B - DNA interaction in the nucleus .,O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
"Antigen receptor signals prolong NF - kappa B - DNA interaction , probably by functionally antagonizing the IL - 1 - induced synthesis of a protein ( s ) responsible for the transient NF - kappa B - DNA interaction and consequently synergistically enhance IL - 1 - induced NF - kappa B - dependent gene transcription .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O

"The single promoter region in the cloned genome [ Noteborn et al . , J . Virol . 65 ( 1991 ) 3131 - 3139 ] of chicken anemia virus ( CAV ) in chicken T - cells was analysed via CAT assays .",O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
"A unique region containing four or five near - perfect direct repeats ( DR ) of 21 bp with one 12 - bp insert was proven to be the main transcription - activation element , with enhancer - like characteristics .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
PCR studies revealed that CAV isolates from across the world all contained this promoter sequence .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Electrophoretic mobility - shift assays ( EMSA ) showed that individual DR units , as well as the 12 - bp insert , can bind to nuclear factors of chicken T - cells .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I O O O O O O
Competition assays revealed that the DR units bound to factors other than the 12 - bp insert .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I O
Purified human SP1 was shown to have very strong affinity for the 12 - bp insert .,O B I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Previous studies using antisense oligonucleotides implicated the c - Myc protein in the phenomenon of activation - induced apoptosis .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
"This role for c - Myc in apoptosis is now confirmed in studies using a dominant negative form of its heterodimeric binding partner , Max , which we show here inhibits activation - induced apoptosis .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
"Further , coexpression of a reciprocally mutant Myc protein capable of forming functional heterodimers with the mutant Max can compensate for the dominant negative activity and restore activation - induced apoptosis .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These results imply that Myc promotes activation - induced apoptosis by obligatory heterodimerization with Max , and therefore , by regulating gene transcription .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
Epstein - Barr virus SM protein .,B I I I I I O
The protein products of the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) BMLF1 open reading frame have been characterized in the early productive cycle in B95 - 8 and Akata cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The SM protein derived from the spliced RNA joining BSLF2 to BMLF1 is much the most abundant protein .,O B I O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O
SM is a phosphoprotein in EBV - infected cells and can be phosphorylated in vitro with casein kinase II ( CKII ) .,B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O
Site - directed mutagenesis of the consensus CKII site in EBV SM greatly reduced the in vitro phosphorylation of SM by CKII .,O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
The mechanism of transactivation by BMLF1 proteins has been controversial but SM was shown to transactivate gene expression from a CAT reporter construct by increasing the amount of cytoplasmic CAT mRNA .,O O O O O B I O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O

"We show that an inducible protein complex ( Band A ) binds to SRE DNA within 10 min after mitogenic stimulation of human PBL - T , and becomes nondetectable by 60 min .",O O O O O B I O B I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A protein that is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue in resting PBL - T suppresses binding of a component of Band A to the SRE motif .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O

In vivo modification of major histocompatibility complex class II DRA promoter occupancy mediated by the AIR - 1 trans - activator .,O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O B I I I I I O
This locus encodes a transcriptional trans - activator required for the constitutive expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II genes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O
"Here we show , by in vivo DNase I footprinting , that the AIR - 1 locus defect correlates with changes in the DRA promoter occupancy .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I O O
"Interestingly , reexpression of human MHC class II genes in RJ 2 . 2 . 5 x mouse spleen cell hybrids is associated with partial reversion of DRA promoter occupancy to the Raji pattern .",O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O

Isolation of cDNA clones for 42 different Kruppel - related zinc finger proteins expressed in the human monoblast cell line U - 937 .,O O B I O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"To study the complexity and structural characteristics of zinc finger proteins expressed during human hematopoiesis and to isolate novel regulators of blood cell development , a degenerate oligonucleotide probe specific for a consensus zinc finger peptide domain was used to isolate 63 cDNA clones for Kruppel - related zinc finger genes from the human monoblast cell line U - 937 .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"By extensive nucleotide sequence and Northern blot analysis , these cDNA clones were found to originate from approximately 42 different genes ( HZF 1 - 42 ) of which only 8 have previously been described .",O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
The large number of individual genes represented among the 63 clones and their apparent non - cell - type - specific expression suggest that the majority of the Kruppel - related zinc finger genes are likely to be expressed in most human tissues .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , some of the genes displayed a restricted expression pattern , indicating that they represent potential regulators of monocyte differentiation or proliferation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Detailed structural analysis of the first 12 cDNAs ( HZF 1 - 10 ) and a partial characterization of HZF 11 - 42 revealed that a common feature of human Kruppel - related zinc finger proteins is the presence of tandem arrays of zinc fingers ranging in number from 3 to over 20 that are preferentially located in the carboxy - terminal regions of the proteins .,O O O O O O O B O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O

Inhibition of activation of transcription factor AP - 1 by CD28 signalling in human T - cells .,O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O
Co - stimulation of T - lymphocytes by T - cell receptor ( TcR ) occupancy and activation of the CD28 surface molecule results in enhanced proliferation and interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) production .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I O B I I O O O
Stimulation of T - cells by agonistic anti - CD28 antibodies in conjunction with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) - or TcR - derived signals induces the enhanced activation of the transcription factor NF - kappa B .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I B I I I O
"Whereas anti - CD28 together with PMA increased the DNA binding and trans - activation activity of NF - kappa B , PMA - induced activation of AP - 1 was significantly suppressed .",O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O
The inhibitory effect exerted by anti - CD28 was observed at the level of DNA binding as well as in functional reporter - gene assays .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that the two transcription factors are independently regulated and may perform different functions during T - cell activation .,O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

An intricate arrangement of binding sites for the Ets family of transcription factors regulates activity of the alpha 4 integrin gene promoter .,O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O O B I I I I O
alpha 4 integrins mediate cell - cell and cell - extracellular matrix interactions that are critical for maturation and function of the immune system as well as differentiation of skeletal muscle .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Both fragments contain the entire ligand binding domain , and the 35 - kDa fragment extended into the hinge region of the receptor .",O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I O O O B I O O O O
Several antiandrogens show agonistic properties for a mutated androgen receptor ( LNCaP cell variant ) ; trypsin digestion of antiandrogen - bound mutated receptor also resulted in a 29 - kDa fragment .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O O B I I I I O O O O B I I I O

Activation of nuclear factor kappa B in human neuroblastoma cell lines .,O O B I I I O O O O O O
The nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) is a eukaryotic transcription factor .,O B I I I O B I I I O O O O B I O
"In B cells and macrophages it is constitutively present in cell nuclei , whereas in many other cell types , NF - kappa B translocates from cytosol to nucleus as a result of transduction by tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) , phorbol ester , and other polyclonal signals .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I O O O O O O O O O O

"We found , moreover , that in SK - N - Be ( 2 ) cells protein kinase C ( PKC ) enzymatic activity was much lower compared with that in a control cell line and that the low PKC enzymatic activity was due to low PKC protein expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O
"NF - kappa B was not activated by retinoic acid , which induced morphological differentiation of all the neuroblastoma cell lines used in the present study .",B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"We focused our studies on the role of Pit - 1 and of PR as potential transcriptional regulators , since the POU domain protein Pit - 1 is essential in the control of pituitary PRL expression , and progesterone induces decidual transformation of the endometrial stroma , a differentiation process during which the decidual PRL gene is activated .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O B O O B I O O O B I I B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O

Results were statistically correlated with those of CD4 + cell counts ( 17 out of 17 ) and with anti - EBV antibody titres ( 13 out of 17 ) assessed using standard immunofluorescence method and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay procedure using recombinant ZEBRA protein and synthetic peptides as antigens .,O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B O
RESULTS : BZLF1 ( ZEBRA ) or early gene products ( EA - R and EA - D / BHLF1 / NotI ) were detected in a small proportion ( < 0 . 01 - 5 % ) of tumour cells in eight of these 17 cases by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization .,O O B O B O O B I I O B I I O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The effects of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) on cytokine production and proliferation of the CD4 + human helper T cell clone SP - B21 were investigated .,O O O B I O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , in cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) / A23187 , PGE2 enhanced the production of IL - 4 and IL - 5 , and only partially inhibited the production of other cytokines .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O B O
"Therefore , the effects of PGE2 vary depending on the mode of T cell activation , and the IL - 4 and IL - 5 are regulated differently from other cytokines .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O B O
"In a mobility shift assay , only the NF - kappa B ( p50 / p50 ) homodimer was observed in a complex formed with the kappa B sequence in unstimulated SP - B21 cells .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
"When cells were stimulated with anti - CD3 mAb or PMA / A23187 , a complex formation of NF - kappa B ( p50 / p65 ) heterodimer with the kappa B sequence was induced .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B B I O O O O B I I O O O
"Interestingly , PGE2 or di - butyryl ( Bt2 ) cAMP abolished the binding of NF - kappa B ( p50 / p65 ) heterodimer to the kappa B sequence in cells stimulated with anti - CD3 mAb but not with PMA / A23187 .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O B I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
Our results suggest that the target of PGE2 action is a component in the signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of protein kinase C .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

Both mobility shift and sequence specificity of NF - AT were similar to those of NF ( P ) and only a small amount of P65 was detected in NF ( P ) in crude nuclear extracts .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B O O O B I I I O O O O O

"Wild - type and chimeric HLF proteins also bound closely related sites identified previously for bZIP proteins of both the proline - and acidic amino acid - rich ( PAR ) and C / EBP subfamilies ; however , E2A - HLF proteins were significantly less tolerant of certain deviations from the HLF consensus binding site .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
These differences were directly attributable to loss of an HLF ancillary DNA - binding domain in all E2A - HLF chimeras and were further exacerbated by a zipper mutation in one isolate .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both wild - type and chimeric HLF proteins displayed transcriptional activator properties in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells on reporter genes containing HLF or C / EBP consensus binding sites .,O B I I O B I I O B I O O O O O O O B I O B I I I I I I I O

The T cell tyrosine kinase ZAP - 70 was found to be highly responsive to UV and H2O2 treatment .,O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

The IC50 of alpha - tcp on an IL - 1 - induced response was 45 microM .,O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O

These events are accompanied by marked increases in the expression of RAG - 1 and RAG - 2 RNAs .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O
These increases occur in the absence of protein synthesis but are dependent on inactivation of the v - abl protein tyrosine kinase .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O

Alternative splicing of RNA transcripts encoded by the murine p105 NF - kappa B gene generates I kappa B gamma isoforms with different inhibitory activities .,O O O B I O O O B I I I I I I O B I I I I O O O O O
"The gene encoding the 105 - kDa protein ( p105 ) precursor of the p50 subunit of transcription factor NF - kappa B also encodes a p70 I kappa B protein , I kappa B gamma , which is identical to the C - terminal 607 amino acids of p105 .",O O O O B I I I I I I I O O B O O O O B I I I O O O B I I I I O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O

Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of CD38 .,O O O O O O O O O O B O

"Two anti - MHC class II Ab , L227 and 2 . 06 , inhibited the growth of B104 cells , although 2 . 06 , but not L227 , needed to be further cross - linked with a goat anti - mouse IgG Ab ( GAM ) to show the effect .",O B I I I I I O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O O O O
"L227 induced an increase in intracellular free Ca2 + concentration ( [ Ca2 + ] i ) from the intracellular pool and little or no protein tyrosine phosphorylation , phosphatidyl inositol turnover , or expression of Egr - 1 mRNA , whereas 2 . 06 plus GAM induced an increase in [ Ca2 + ] i from both the intracellular and , in particular , the extracellular pools .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The inhibition of B104 cell growth induced by anti - MHC class II Ab was Ca ( 2 + ) - independent and not inhibited by actinomycin D or cyclosporin A , and cell cycle arrest at the G2 / M interphase was not observed .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These features are very different from those observed in B104 cell death induced by anti - IgM Ab .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Neither DNA fragmentation nor the morphology of apoptosis was observed .,O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings demonstrate that cross - linking of MHC class II molecules transduced the negative signals through intracellular mechanisms different from those present in the cross - linking of surface IgM .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Functional block for 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 - mediated gene regulation in human B lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Elements necessary for the steroid hormone 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 ) to induce a biological response include the presence of specific intracellular receptors ( vitamin D3 receptors ( VDR ) ) and modulation of gene expression via hormone - activated receptor binding to regulatory regions of target genes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O
"These parameters were examined in normal and Epstein - Barr virus - immortalized human B cells and compared with 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 - responsive cells of the T and monocytic lineages .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Although resting tonsillar B cells did not express VDR mRNA , activation of these cells with interleukin - 4 induced VDR in the absence of exogenously supplemented 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"As indicators of hormone - mediated gene regulation we analyzed modulation of CD23 , a common B cell / monocyte surface antigen , and 24 - hydroxylase .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I I I O O B I I O
"1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 inhibited CD23 expression in U937 cells , yet failed to modulate CD23 expression in B cells .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"Furthermore , 1 alpha , 25 - ( OH ) 2D3 induced 24 - hydroxylase mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both U937 cells and lectin - activated T cells , yet failed to induce 24 - hydroxylase mRNA or its metabolic activity in B cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
"These findings suggest that although human B lymphocytes can express VDR mRNA and protein , they exhibit a functional block for vitamin D - dependent gene regulation .",O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Positive and negative regulation of IL - 2 gene expression : role of multiple regulatory sites .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) is an important lymphokine required in the process of T cell activation , proliferation , clonal expansion and differentiation .",O O O B I I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The IL - 2 gene displays both T cell specific and inducible expression : it is only expressed in CD4 + T cells after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation .,O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Several cis - acting regulatory sites are required for induction of the IL - 2 gene after stimulation .,O B I I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O
"In this study , we have analysed the function of these cis - acting regulatory sites in the context of the native IL - 2 enhancer and promoter sequence .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B I I I O B I O
"The results of this study suggest that the NFAT ( - 276 to - 261 ) , the distal octamer ( - 256 to - 248 ) and the proximal octamer ( - 75 to - 66 ) sites not only act as enhancers of IL - 2 gene transcription in the presence of cellular stimulation , but also have a silencing effect on IL - 2 gene expression in resting cells .",O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O O O B I O B I I I I O O O B I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
Two other sites display disparate effects on IL - 2 gene expression in different T leukemia cell lines : the distal purine box ( - 291 to - 277 ) and the proximal purine box sites ( - 145 to - 128 ) .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O B I I I O B I I I I O O
"Finally , the AP - 1 ( - 186 to - 176 ) and the kappa B sites ( - 206 to - 195 ) respond to different cellular activation in EL4 cells .",O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
The AP - 1 site mediated the response to PMA stimulation while the kappa B site responded to IL - 1 stimulation .,O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O
These data suggest that the regulation of IL - 2 gene expression is a complex process and multiple cis - acting regulatory sites interact to exert different effects in T cells representative of alternative stages of differentiation .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sp1 is a critical factor for the monocytic specific expression of human CD14 .,B O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"CD14 is a membrane glycoprotein expressed specifically on monocytes and macrophages , and its expression is markedly increased during the process of monocyte differentiation .",B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A 5 . 5 - kilobase genomic clone contained the full - length CD14 coding sequence and 4 . 2 kilobases of 5 ' - upstream sequence .,O B I I I I I I O O O O O B I I O B I I I I I I I I I O
"One major and one minor transcription start site were identified 101 and 130 base pairs ( bp ) upstream , respectively , from the protein translation start ATG .",O B I I I I I I O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O B I I I O
"A DNA fragment containing 128 bp of upstream sequence had strong , monocyte - specific promoter activity in the CD14 positive monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 as compared to the nonmonocytic cell lines HeLa and REX .",O B I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Mutation of the major Sp1 binding site ( - 110 bp ) decreased tissue - specific promoter activity , and these results , together with transactivation experiments , demonstrate that Sp1 plays a critical role in the tissue - specific expression of CD14 in monocytic cells .",O O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
"CD14 Sp1 site oligonucleotides bound preferentially to a 105 - kDa Sp1 species , which is present in higher relative levels in monocytic than non - monocytic cells , suggesting that modification of Sp1 , such as phosphorylation , may explain how the Sp1 site mediates monocytic specific promoter activity .",B B O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The interleukin - 8 AP - 1 and kappa B - like sites are genetic end targets of FK506 - sensitive pathway accompanied by calcium mobilization .,O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"FK506 , an immunosuppressant , inhibits the production of several cytokines in T lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
"We observed that FK506 suppressed the transcription of a chemotactic cytokine , interleukin - 8 ( IL - 8 ) in a human T cell line , Jurkat cells , activated by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ( Ca2 + ) ionophore ( ionomycin ) .",O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"By deleted and mutated analysis of the IL - 8 promoters , the AP - 1 and kappa B - like sites were identified as the responsive elements for PMA and ionomycin .",O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"FK506 suppressed the transcriptions through the AP - 1 or kappa B - like sites induced by PMA plus Ca ( 2 + ) - mobilizing agents , but not those induced by Ca ( 2 + ) - independent stimuli .",O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In gel retardation analysis , FK506 had little effect on the binding to the AP - 1 site of PMA / ionomycin - induced nuclear factors , which were recognized with anti - JunD or c - Fos antibody .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O
"In contrast , FK506 or EGTA ( Ca2 + chelator ) similarly affected the formation of kappa B - like site binding complexes , which were not recognized by any antibodies against the human Rel family proteins ( c - Rel , p65 , p50 , and p49 ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O B O O B I I I O B I I O B O B O O B O O
"Furthermore , we confirmed the previous report that FK506 suppressed the PMA / ionomycin - induced activation through authentic kappa B site of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) gene , to which NF - kappa B binding was also decreased by FK506 , indicating that both IL - 8 kappa B - like site and Ig kappa B site are FK506 - sensitive in spite of the difference of binding factors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Our results indicate that not only the reported IL - 2 NF - AT and NFIL - 2A sites and Ig kappa B site , but also the IL - 8 AP - 1 and kappa B - like sites are terminals of FK506 - sensitive pathway involving Ca2 + mobilization .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O O B I I O O O O B I I B I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Androgen binding sites in peripheral human mononuclear leukocytes of healthy males and females .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Androgen binding sites have been identified in circulating human mononuclear leukocytes of healthy donors of both sexes .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cells were separated from blood samples on a Ficoll gradient and incubated with different concentrations of [ 3H ] testosterone in the presence or absence of a 400 - fold excess of unlabelled testosterone .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The binding sites fulfil the required criteria for specific steroid binding sites however differ somewhat from the classic androgen receptors from genital skin fibroblast : in fertile adult males ( n = 20 ) the binding sites showed ( 1 ) a high affinity for testosterone ( 1 . 32 + / - 0 . 49 nM ; mean + / - SD ) , ( 2 ) a saturable capacity ( 184 + / - 52 binding sites per cell ; mean + / - SD ) , and ( 3 ) a characteristic competitive binding profile for other steroid hormones ( relative binding affinities : testosterone = dihydrotestosterone > 17 beta - estradiol > progesterone , whereas aldosterone , 17 - hydroxy - progesterone and cortisol did not compete appreciably ) .",O B I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore the number of binding sites determined using [ 3H ] dihydrotestosterone , [ 3H ] RU - 1881 , or [ 3H ] testosterone were comparable .",O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This raises the possibility that androgen receptors in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes differ from those in genital skin fibroblasts .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no apparent correlation between serum testosterone concentrations and androgen binding sites .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"The presence of androgen receptors in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes provides for the first time the experimental basis for an hypothesis of direct , receptor - mediated effects of androgens on mature immunocompetent cells .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Induction of IL - 8 expression in T cells uses the CD28 costimulatory pathway .,O O B I I O O O O O O B O O O
"IL - 8 , a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophil granulocytes and lymphocytes , is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted by a variety of cell types , including T cells .",B I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Anti - CD28 - stimulated T cells produced significant amounts of IL - 8 ; additionally , costimulation with anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 Abs resulted in a synergistic induction of IL - 8 secretion .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O O
"Sequence homology , single nucleotide mutations , and anti - CD28 Ab stimulation studies established that the NF - kappa B - like sequence in the promoter of the IL - 8 gene functioned as a CD28 response element .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I I I I O O B O O B I I I O O O B I I O
"Furthermore , cyclosporin A , but not rapamycin , blocked the synergistic induction of IL - 8 expression achieved with anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 costimulation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O B O O
"The involvement of a CD28 response element in the induction of IL - 8 expression in activated T cells may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and persistence of immune disorders characterized by increased levels of IL - 8 , such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis .",O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
MHC class II signaling in B - cell activation [ see comments ],B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"The cognate interaction between T cells and antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) , mediated by major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II molecules , results in the delivery of activation signals to the APC .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
These signals contribute to the expression of co - stimulatory activity by APCs and have important consequences for cell effector function .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MHC class II molecules also serve as receptors for B - cell stimulation by microbial superantigens .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"In this review , Paul Scholl and Raif Geha discuss recent advances in our understanding of mechanisms of MHC class II signaling and analyse their role in human B - cell activation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Effects of glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis .,O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE .,O O
"Lymphocytes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) have diminished receptor density ; thus , patients with RA should show partial resistance to glucocorticoids .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the glucocorticoid sensitivity of lymphocytes in RA patients compared with healthy subjects .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS .,O O
We determined the effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine release .,O O O O O O O O O O B O O
RESULTS .,O O
Proliferation and cytokine release were inhibited in RA patients to the same extent as in healthy controls .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION .,O O
Diminished receptor density in RA patients does not result in glucocorticoid resistance .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Arrested development : understanding v - abl .,O O O O B I I O
The protein tyrosine kinase activity of the v - abl oncogene has been demonstrated to subvert the normal second messenger systems used by lymphoid cells for growth and differentiation .,O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Transformation of bone marrow with the Abelson murine leukemia virus results in the appearance of B cell lineage cells arrested at the pre - B cell stage .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recent reports have characterized these cells expressing high v - abl kinase activity as deficient in detectable NF - kappaB DNA binding activity and low level RAG gene expression .,O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I O O
These observations suggest that v - abl may be inhibiting the differentiation of B cells by blocking these two crucial elements in the maturation pathway .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Corticosteroid receptors in lymphocytes : a possible marker of brain involution ?,B I O O O O O O O O O O
A similarity has recently been found between the regulation of corticosteroid receptors in brain and in lymphoid tissue .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
We have studied the regulation of corticosteroid receptors in human mononuclear leukocytes as a possible marker of brain involution .,O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Type I corticosteroid receptors are down regulated by excess of mineralocorticoids ( primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism , pseudohyperaldostero ) and of glucocorticoids ( Cushing ' s syndrome ) . Type II corticosteroid receptors are not reduced by excess of endogenous corticosteroids ( Cushing ' s syndrome ) .",B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In normal adults there is a direct significant correlation between plasma cortisol and Type I and between plasma cortisol and Type II receptors in mononuclear leukocytes , while in Cushing ' s syndrome the correlation is inverse between plasma cortisol at 8 a . m . and Type II receptors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"In an aged population the mean numbers of Type I and of Type II receptors are lower and plasma cortisol is higher than in adult controls , but the increase of plasma cortisol is not followed by a clinical picture of hypercorticism .",O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After dexamethasone suppression ( 1 mg at 11 p . m . ) Type I receptors always decrease in controls while the response of Type II is not homogeneous .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
"In an aged group of patients , both receptors are reduced by dexamethasone .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We conclude that the decrease with age of corticosteroid receptors is possibly related to a physiological involution of corticosteroid receptors and that this reduction does increase plasma cortisol concentration , without affecting the glucocorticoid effector mechanism .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All - trans retinoic acid ( RA ) induces differentiation of HL60 cells to neutrophils and is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We observed that RA did not induced neutrophil differentiation in serum - free grown HL60 cells whereas 50 nM 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( D3 ) induced maximal monocyte differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increasing RA concentrations reduced the D3 concentration required for monocyte differentiation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Cells treated with 5 nM D3 showed little response , but differentiated maximally with 5 nM D3 and 10 nM RA .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The D3 analogs MC903 , EB1089 and KH1060 were more potent inducers of monocyte differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The extent to which analog activity was increased after cotreatment with RA was inversely related to potency .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - four hour treatment with 10 nM RA primed cells for response to 5 nM D3 ; the reverse sequence being ineffective .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Priming with 10 nM RA , or subsequent treatment with D3 ( 5 nM ) , did not alter expression of mRNAs encoding receptors for D3 ( VDR ) , RA ( RAR alpha ) or 9 - CIS RA ( RXR alpha , beta , gamma ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O B O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O
[ An overexpression of retinoic acid receptor alpha blocks myeloid cell differentiation at the promyelocyte stage ],O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
"Retinoic acid ( RA ) , a vitamin A derivative , exerts a wide range of biological effects related to cell proliferation and differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pleiotropic effects of RA are thought to be mediated through specific nuclear RA receptors ( RARs ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O
RARs are members of the steroid / thyroid hormone receptor superfamily and exhibit a molecular structure that possess discrete DNA - binding and RA ( ligand ) - binding domains .,B O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"In hematopoietic system , RA and RARs , predominantly RAR alpha may play key roles for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors .",O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , it is currently unknown how RA and RARs are involved in regulating normal hematopoietic differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"To make clear the roles of RA and RAR alpha in the normal hematopoiesis , I have introduced the construct of human RAR alpha ( hRAR alpha ) into murine bone marrow cells with retroviral vector , and selected infected cells with drug resistant marker ( Neo ( r ) ) cultured on the stroma cell line ( PA6 - neo ) , and analyzed the behavior of infected cells .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All of procedure were done in vitro .,O O O O O O O O
Most cells infected with hRAR alpha exhibited promyelocytic morphology and were thought to be blocked at the promyelocytic stage in their myeloid differentiation .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , these immature cells differentiated terminally into mature granulocytes by adding with RA ( 10 ( - 6 ) M ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RAR alpha infected cells were also able to differentiate into mature macrophages in the both of long term culture and IL3 colony .,B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These observations suggest that an overexpression of RAR alpha alone is effective to suppress myeloid cell differentiation and RAR alpha plays a crucial role in the terminal differentiation of myeloid precursors .,O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
The system described here may serve as a model for studying the the essential genes for differentiation of normal bone marrow cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Hypoxic induction of interleukin - 8 gene expression in human endothelial cells .,O O O B I I I O O O O O O
"Because leukocyte - mediated tissue damage is an important component of the pathologic picture in ischemia / reperfusion , we have sought mechanisms by which PMNs are directed into hypoxic tissue .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Incubation of human endothelial cells ( ECs ) in hypoxia , PO2 approximately 14 - 18 Torr , led to time - dependent release of IL - 8 antigen into the conditioned medium ; this was accompanied by increased chemotactic activity for PMNs , blocked by antibody to IL - 8 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Production of IL - 8 by hypoxic ECs occurred concomitantly with both increased levels of IL - 8 mRNA , based on polymerase chain reaction analysis , and increased IL - 8 transcription , based on nuclear run - on assays .",O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Northern analysis of mRNA from hypoxic ECs also demonstrated increased levels of mRNA for macrophage chemotactic protein - 1 , another member of the chemokine superfamily of proinflammatory cytokines .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O O O O O B I O B I O
IL - 8 gene induction was associated with the presence of increased binding activity in nuclear extracts from hypoxic ECs for the NF - kB site .,B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Studies with human umbilical vein segments exposed to hypoxia also demonstrated increased elaboration of IL - 8 antigen compared with normoxic controls .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
"In mice exposed to hypoxia ( PO2 approximately 30 - 40 Torr ) , there was increased pulmonary leukostasis , as evidenced by increased myeloperoxidase activity in tissue homogenates .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"In parallel , increased levels of transcripts for IP - 10 , a murine homologue in the chemokine family related to IL - 8 , were observed in hypoxic lung tissue .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O
"Taken together , these data suggest that hypoxia constitutes a stimulus for leukocyte chemotaxis and tissue leukostasis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thrombin stimulation of the T leukemic cell line Jurkat induced a transient increase in [ Ca2 + ] i .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was required for this effect since diisopropyl fluorophosphate - thrombin failed to increase [ Ca2 + ] i .,O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , hirudin and anti - thrombin III inhibited the thrombin - induced [ Ca2 + ] i rise in Jurkat T cells .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A synthetic thrombin receptor agonist peptide ( TRP ) of 7 residues ( SFLLRNP ) was found to be as effective as thrombin for [ Ca2 + ] i mobilization , and both agonists induced Ca2 + release exclusively from internal stores .",O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of molecular mass 40 , 42 , 70 , 120 , and 130 kDa .",B O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O
Thrombin and TRP also caused translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the plasma membrane .,B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
"As a likely consequence of these events , thrombin activated the nuclear factor NF - kB .",O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I O
"Several cell lines of hematopoietic origin including the leukemic T cell line HPB . ALL and the erythroleukemic cell line K562 were responsive to thrombin , whereas others such as THP1 , a myelomonocytic cell line , and BL2 , a Burkitt lymphoma were refractory to thrombin or TRP stimulation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
The magnitude of the thrombin response in the different cell types paralleled the expression of the thrombin receptor mRNA .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
We found that activation of Jurkat T cells by a combination of phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate led to a dramatic inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression and to a concomitant loss of the thrombin response .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O
"Finally , we demonstrate that thrombin and TRP enhanced CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production induced by T cell receptor cross - linking in both Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes .",O O O O O B O O O B O O B I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings highlight the role of thrombin as a potential regulator of T lymphocyte activation .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
A second feature of senescent T cells is the dramatic reduction in hsp70 production in response to heat shock .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
This decline is associated with a decrease in binding of nuclear extracts to the consensus heat shock element .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"This suggests that for senescent T cells the reduced ability to respond to heat shock by producing hsp70 , although possibly lying at the level of transcriptional control , may nevertheless be unrelated to the reduced DNA synthesis or the diminished proliferative activity also manifested by these cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Involvement of phospholipase D in the activation of transcription factor AP - 1 in human T lymphoid Jurkat cells .,O O B I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O
The induction of the AP - 1 transcription factor has been ascribed to the early events leading to T lymphocyte activation .,O O O O B I I B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have examined the possibility that stimulation of phospholipase D ( PLD ) may regulate activation of transcription factor AP - 1 in human T cells by transfecting human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells with a plasmid containing an AP - 1 enhancer element and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene .,O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I I O
"We have detected activatable PLD in Jurkat cells , and we have found that addition of phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , the physiologic product of PLD action on phospholipids , is rapidly incorporated into Jurkat cells and leads to activation of transcription factor AP - 1 .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti - CD3 mAb activated both PLD and transcription factor AP - 1 .,O O O O O B I I I O O B O B I I I I O
"Furthermore , ethanol , an inhibitor of the PLD pathway , blocked the anti - CD3 - stimulated AP - 1 enhancer activity .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
"However , this anti - CD3 - mediated response was not inhibited by neomycin , an inhibitor of phosphoinositide hydrolysis .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The increases in AP - 1 enhancer activity induced by PA or anti - CD3 mAb were efficiently abrogated by the presence of propranolol , an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase and protein kinase C ( PKC ) .",O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O B O O
"Furthermore , the PA - and the anti - CD3 - induced increases in AP - 1 enhancer activity were blocked by the presence of PKC inhibitors or by PKC down - regulation .",O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O
"These data indicate that PLD stimulation can activate the transcription factor AP - 1 in T lymphocytes , and suggest that the induction of AP - 1 enhancer factor activity by PA is mediated via PKC stimulation , either through a direct activating effect of PA or through PA - derived diacylglycerol formation .",O O O O B O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These data also provide evidence for a role of PLD - derived lipids in the induction of AP - 1 enhancer activity resulting from stimulation of the TCR / CD3 complex , suggesting that increased PLD activity can play an important role in T lymphocyte activation .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
Upregulation of bcl - 2 by the Epstein - Barr virus latent membrane protein LMP1 : a B - cell - specific response that is delayed relative to NF - kappa B activation and to induction of cell surface markers .,O O B I I O O B I I I I I I B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I O
"An ability of the Epstein - Barr virus latent membrane protein LMP1 to enhance the survival of infected B cells through upregulation of the bcl - 2 oncogene was first suggested by experiments involving gene transfection and the selection of stable LMP1 + clones ( S . Henderson , M . Rowe , C . Gregory , F . Wang , E . Kieff , and A . Rickinson , Cell 65 : 1107 - 1115 , 1991 ) .",O O O O B I I I I I I B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , it was not possible to ascertain whether Bcl - 2 upregulation was a specific consequence of LMP1 expression or an artifact of the selection procedure whereby rare Bcl - 2 + cells already present in the starting population might best be able to tolerate the potentially toxic effects of LMP1 .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"In the first approach , stable clones of two B - cell lines carrying an LMP1 gene under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter were induced to express LMP1 in all cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O O B O O O O
Activation of NK - kappa B and upregulation of ICAM - 1 occurred within 24 h and were followed at 48 to 72 h by upregulation of Bcl - 2 .,O O B I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"All six B - cell lines tested showed NF - kappa B activation in response to LMP1 expression , and this was followed in five of six lines by expression of ICAM - 1 and Bcl - 2 .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O
We therefore conclude that Bcl - 2 upregulation is part of the panoply of cellular changes induced by LMP1 but that the effect is cell type specific .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"Our data also suggest that whilst NF - kappa B may be an essential component of LMP1 signal transduction , other cell - specific factors may be required to effect some functions of the viral protein .",O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Long - term inositol phosphate release , but not tyrosine kinase activity , correlates with IL - 2 secretion and NF - AT induction in anti - CD3 - activated peripheral human T lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
The cascade of events within the first few minutes of T cell stimulation has been well characterized .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Although many second messengers have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for T cell activation in a number of model systems , the rate - limiting step in peripheral T cells has not been demonstrated .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To model effective versus ineffective CD3 - mediated stimulation in peripheral T cells , we used two anti - CD3 mAbs that differ in their ability to stimulate purified T cells : OKT3 , which causes early second messenger generation but is unable to activate T cells without a second signal , and 64 . 1 , which stimulates T cell proliferation on its own .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"However , only 64 . 1 induced NF - AT in the nucleus , correlating with its ability to activate T cells .",O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Induction of proto - oncogene and cytokine expression in human peripheral blood monocytes and the monocytic cell line THP - 1 after stimulation with mycoplasma - derived material MDHM .,O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mycoplasma fermentans - derived high - molecular - weight material ( MDHM ) was originally described to induce differentiation of murine thymocytes to cytolytic effector T - cells by stimulating IL - 6 release from adherent cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
"This study shows that human peripheral blood monocytes ( PBMo ) also respond to MDHM with increases in IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 and TNF alpha expression , both at the mRNA and protein level .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O B I O O O O O O O O O O
The induced expression of IL - 1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA in the monocytic THP - 1 cell line increased as quickly as in primary cells .,O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast to PBMo , THP - 1 and 14 other monocytic / myeloid leukemia - derived cell lines did not secrete measurable amounts of the cytokines upon treatment with MDHM .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"IL - 1 beta and IL - 6 genes contain AP - 1 binding sites as regulatory elements , the AP - 1 protein being composed of c - jun and c - fos gene products .",B I I I I I I I I O B I I I I O B I O O B I I O O O O B I I I I I I I I O
In THP - 1 cells c - jun mRNA expression increased after incubation with MDHM while positive c - fos expression remained unaffected .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
In the primary cells MDHM - induced elevation of cytokine mRNA levels was preceded by a downregulation of c - fos expression while positive c - jun expression was not modulated .,O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O
"c - myc mRNA expression , constitutively high in THP - 1 cells , was induced in MDHM - stimulated PBMo .",B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In conclusion , MDHM - stimulated induction of cytokine mRNA expression was accompanied by different proto - oncogene responses in PBMo and THP - 1 cells .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Alternatively , these data support the notion that neither AP - 1 nor the c - myc protein are involved in the MDHM - induced increase in IL - 1 beta , IL - 6 or TNF alpha mRNA levels .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The increase in mRNA accumulation was at least partly due to an increase in the transcription rates of the respective genes and was accompanied by a strong induction of nuclear factor - kappa B and activator protein - 1 transcription factor expression .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"This size discrepancy appeared to be due to cell - specific translational regulation , since overexpression of a retrovirally transfected SCL gene yielded the higher molecular weight forms in most cell lines ( GP + E - 86 , AT2 . 5 , M1 ) but only the 22 kDa form in the myeloid cell line , WEHI - 3B / D + .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and T - cell activation by vanadate peroxide , an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of key cellular proteins is a crucial event in the transduction of activation signals to T - lymphocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The regulatory role of protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPases ) in this process was explored by studying the effects of a powerful PTPase inhibitor , vanadate peroxide ( pervanadate ) , on the activation cascade of Jurkat human leukaemic T - cells .",O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Pervanadate induced activation of the tyrosine kinases lck and fyn ( 4 - and 3 - fold respectively ) and a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins , notably phospholipase C gamma 1 .",O O O O O B I B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I O
"After this event , we observed a rise in intracellular Ca2 + concentration , corresponding to an influx .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In the CD45 - negative variant , the effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation was globally decreased and some phosphorylated substrates were specifically missing .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pervanadate also stimulated transcription of the c - fos gene and accumulation of its mRNA as well as several other hallmarks of T - lymphocyte activation such as surface expression of the CD69 antigen and the interleukin 2 receptor alpha - chain ( CD25 ) .,O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pervanadate synergized with signals delivered by T - cell antigen receptor engagement or by a phorbol ester to induce interleukin 2 production .,O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
We thus conclude that PTPases play a crucial role in the negative regulation of signal transduction culminating in T - lymphocyte activation .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"TCR signaling was triggered by treating Jurkat T cells with PHA or anti - CD3 Abs , and NF - kappaB activation was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and / or by kappaB - dependent reporter assays .",B O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"Contrary to the idea that protein kinase C is involved in TCR - mediated activation of NF - kappaB , high doses of staurosporine did not interfere with activation of NF - kappaB by PHA , while the same dose of staurosporine completely blocked activation by PMA .",O O O O O B I I O O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"The TCR - mediated activation of NF - kappaB was also dependent on a Ca2 + influx , because the Ca2 + channel blocker , SK & F 96365 , as well as other agents that prevented the Ca2 + influx , inhibited NF - kappaB activation .",O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O

Function and activation of NF - kappa B in the immune system .,O O O O B I I I O O O O O
NF - kappa B is a ubiquitous transcription factor .,B I I I O O B I I O
"Nevertheless , its properties seem to be most extensively exploited in cells of the immune system .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Among these properties are NF - kappa B ' s rapid posttranslational activation in response to many pathogenic signals , its direct participation in cytoplasmic / nuclear signaling , and its potency to activate transcription of a great variety of genes encoding immunologically relevant proteins .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

The nature of the nuclear factors involved in regulation of these cytokine genes is still unknown .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
Nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ; heterodimer of p50 and p65 ) proteins have been suggested to play an important role in gene transcription of inflammatory mediators when monocytes are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide .,B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
"Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs such as salicylates have been used to treat symptoms of inflammation , and a new mechanism of drug action was suggested recently .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Lack of IL - 12 signaling in human allergen - specific Th2 cells .,O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
IL - 12 is a powerful skewer of CD4 + T cell responses toward the Th1 phenotype by inducing IFN - gamma production in naive Th cells .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O

Increased natural killer cell activity correlates with low or negative expression of the HER - 2 / neu oncogene in patients with breast cancer .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O
BACKGROUND .,O O
Increased expression of the HER - 2 / neu oncogene in breast cancer correlates with decreased estrogen receptor concentration and seems to be an important prognostic factor .,O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
The authors investigated whether there is a correlation between HER - 2 / neu expression and immunologic parameters representing tumor defense in patients with breast cancer .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHOD .,O O
"A Western blot analysis was used to investigate HER - 2 / neu expression , whereas a chromium - release assay using the K562 cell line as target was used to measure natural killer ( NK ) cell activity .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS .,O O
"In patients with breast cancer , NK cell activity was significantly higher compared with patients with benign tumors ( P = 0 . 006 ) or healthy control subjects ( P = 0 . 002 ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Moreover , 23 . 3 % of patients with breast cancer showed an overexpression of HER - 2 / neu protein .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
"Within this group of patients , NK cell activity was significantly lower ( 45 . 6 + / - 16 . 1 % ) compared with the group with no HER - 2 / neu overexpression ( 57 . 3 + / - 11 . 0 % ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
NK cell activity did not increase in patients with HER - 2 / neu overexpression .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O
"Thus , there was a statistically significant correlation of cytolytic effector cell function with HER - 2 / neu expression of the tumor ( P = 0 . 003 ) , and HER - 2 / neu overexpression correlated with a negative estrogen receptor status ( P = 0 . 005 ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
These data add further evidence to previous observations from the authors ' laboratory that certain tumor characteristics may be associated with reactions of the host with breast cancer .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
[ The value of the clinical test of glucocorticoid receptors of peripheral blood leukocytes in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease ],O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In order to inquire into the functional state of adrenal cortex in patients with pulmonary heart disease , the number of glucocorticoid receptors ( GCR ) of peripheral blood leukocytes in patients with chronic pulmonary heart disease was determined with radioligand - binding assay and the corresponding plasma cortisol levels were assessed with radioimmune assays .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results showed that the number of GCR in the patients was significantly reduced ( P < 0 . 01 ) and it was increased when their health state was improved .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , it was still lower than that in healthy subjects ( P < 0 . 01 ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The number of GCR in the patients was greatly increased when these patients were treated with oxygen ( P < 0 . 01 ) .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No difference in plasma cortisol was found between the patients and the healthy subjects ( P > 0 . 05 ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These results indicate that the function of adrenal cortex may be improved by the compensation mechanism of the patients , but the lower GCR number was the result of lacking of oxygen in the patients .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore oxygen therapy is helpful in raising the activity of glucocorticoid receptors and controlling the development of the disease .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Both IL - 2 and IL - 4 bind to receptors containing the common gamma chain and JAK3 .,O B I I O B I I O O O O O B I I O B O

"Here , we have studied IL - 2 and IL - 4 signaling in B cell lines lacking JAK3 .",O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O B O
"Although IL - 2 - induced phosphorylation of IL - 2R beta , JAK1 , and STAT5 all required the presence of JAK3 , IL - 4 - mediated phosphorylation of JAK1 , STAT6 , and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 did not .",O B I I O O O O B I I I O B O O B O O O O O B O B I I O O O O B O B O O B I O O O O O O O
"These data indicate that IL - 4 signaling occurs in the absence of of JAK3 , but is comparatively inefficient .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
These findings may help in understanding the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency that occurs with mutations of JAK3 and may suggest a mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of IL - 4 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

"PRRII is a T - cell - specific enhancer , located between nucleotides - 137 and - 64 , which binds the T - cell - specific Ets protein Elf - 1 and HMG - I ( Y ) proteins .",B O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I B I I O B I I I I I I O
"However , none of these proximal regions account for the induction of IL - 2R alpha transcription by IL - 2 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"To find new regulatory regions of the IL - 2R alpha gene , 8 . 5 kb of the 5 ' end noncoding sequence of the IL - 2R alpha gene have been sequenced .",O O O B I O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O
"This putative human IL - 2rE , designated PRRIII , confers IL - 2 responsiveness on a heterologous promoter .",O O B I I I O O B O O B I I O O O B I O
PRRIII contains a Stat protein binding site that overlaps with an EBS motif ( GASd / EBSd ) .,B O O B I I I O O O O B I O B I I O O
These are essential for IL - 2 inducibility of PRRIII / CAT reporter constructs .,O O O O B I I O O B I I I I O
IL - 2 induced the binding of Stat5a and b proteins to the human GASd element .,B I I O O O O B I I I O O B I I O
"To confirm the physiological relevance of these findings , we carried out in vivo footprinting experiments which showed that stimulation of IL - 2R alpha expression correlated with occupancy of the GASd element .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I O
Our data demonstrate a major role of the GASd / EBSd element in IL - 2R alpha regulation and suggest that the T - cell - specific Elf - 1 factor can serve as a transcriptional repressor .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O B I O

An overexpression of p50 has been described in follicular dendritic cells ( FDC ) .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
A constitutive NF - kappa B activity has been reported in mature macrophages .,O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
This led to the hypothesis that some of the Rel / NF - kappa B proteins were key nuclear factors in functions of accessory cells of the immune response .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O

"In the erythroleukemia cell line K562 , due to the absence of Spi - B , only PU . 1 bound to the Btk promoter .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O B I O
Mutation of either site reduced the expression in transient transfection experiments .,O O O O O O O O O O O O

Rheumatoid arthritis is a multistep disorder associated with autoimmune features of yet unknown etiology .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Implication of viruses such as Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis has been suspected on the basis of several indirect observations , but thus far , a direct link between EBV and rheumatoid arthritis has not been provided .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we show that a large fraction of T cells infiltrating affected joints from a patient with chronic rheumatoid arthritis recognizes two EBV transactivators ( BZLF1 and BMLF1 ) in a major histocompatibility complex - restricted fashion .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O B O O O B I I O O O O
Responses to these EBV antigens by synovial lymphocytes from several other chronic rheumatoid arthritis patients were readily detectable .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cloning and characterization of NF - ATc and NF - ATp : the cytoplasmic components of NF - AT .,O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O B I I O
Present evidence indicates a pathway of signal transmission in T cells that is outlined in figure 1 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The elevation in intracellular calcium that is induced by interactions at the antigen receptor leads to the activation of the calcium - dependent phosphatase calcineurin .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I B O
This in turn leads to the nuclear association of the cytosolic component of NF - ATc .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O
The activation of calcineurin and the nuclear import of NF - ATc can both be blocked by cyclosporin A or FK506 in complex with their respective immunophilins .,O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Once in the nucleus , NF - ATc interacts with NF - ATn to form an active transcriptional complex .",O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O B I I O

"The findings presented here link an atheogenic lipoprotein , LDL , with the induction of an adhesion molecule important in atherogenesis Human LDL induces the vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) transcriptionally with an increase in mRNA levels through activation of the VCAM promoter .",O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"After a 2 - day incubation in LDL , the binding of NF - kappa B , which is believed to be a key oxidative - stress sensor for VCAM regulation , remains at basal level .",O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O

"Therefore we first examined the participation of NF - kappa B in germline C epsilon transcription in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell line , DND39 .",O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Stimulation of DND39 cells with IL - 4 or anti - CD40 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) activated phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase and subsequently induced nuclear expression of NF - kappa B , which was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .",O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O B O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O

"Second , we studied the effect of NAC on IgE synthesis in human normal B cells costimulated with IL - 4 and anti - CD40 mAb .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O
NAC was effective in inhibiting mature C epsilon transcription and IgE synthesis in the T cell - independent culture system .,O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
"However , NAC did not significantly affect the spontaneous production of IgE by atopic B cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O

We examined bone marrow cells by reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) to detect residual PML / RAR alpha mRNA - containing cells following treatment with all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) and cytotoxic chemotherapy in a patient with APL .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This RT - PCR assay can detect one leukemic cell in 10 ( 2 ) normal cells in vitro .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We show that PML / RAR alpha mRNA was still detectable despite clinical remission following ATRA treatment , but undetectable following consolidation with chemotherapy .",O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data show that this technique is useful for the identification of minimal residual disease in patients with APL and that cytotoxic chemotherapy following ATRA therapy is required for the elimination of APL cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Glucocorticoid - mediated inhibition of interleukin - 2 receptor alpha and - beta subunit expression by human T cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To determine the mechanism of glucocorticoid ( GC ) - mediated inhibition of T cell functions , the effect of dexamethasone ( DM ) on T cell proliferation and interleukin - 2 receptor ( IL - 2R ) generation were studied .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O
"Dexamethasone inhibited IL - 2 - induced T cell proliferation by 30 % - 88 % , relative to its concentration within the cultures .",O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The effect of DM on expression of IL - 2R alpha ( Tac , p55 , CD25 ) and beta ( p75 ) genes in activated T cells was examined next .",O O O O O O O B I I I O B O B O B O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O
In T cells stimulated with purified phytohemagglutinin ( PHA - p ) and 4 beta - phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) addition of DM to the cultures resulted in a 60 % reduction in IL - 2R alpha and a 30 % reduction in IL - 2R beta membrane expression compared to T cells cultured in the absence of DM ( p < 0 . 01 ) .,O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"By Northern blot analysis , DM caused a comparable decrease in IL - 2R alpha and in IL - 2R beta mRNA levels to membrane receptor expression in mitogen - stimulated T cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"By in vitro transcription assays , DM regulated IL - 2R alpha gene expression at a transcriptional level while transcription of IL - 2R beta gene was unaffected by DM .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O
The data indicate that 10 ( - 6 ) M DM increased T cell p50 NF - kappa B mRNA levels by four - fold compared to the levels obtained in the absence of DM .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Further , the level of nuclear proteins capable of binding to the NF - kappa B sites in activated T cells increased in response to DM .",O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"In sum , DM regulates T cell membrane expression of IL - 2R by more than one molecular mechanism .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
Alteration of structural order of human erythrocyte ghost membrane by glucocorticoids and the influence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
High - dose pulse glucocorticoid therapy has been used successfully in the clinic in severe pathological conditions for about 20 years .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mode of glucocorticoid action after administration of such megadoses is inexplicable up to now .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is supposed that some effects may be due to membrane alterations .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In the present in - vitro experiments the effect of dexamethasone , of further glucocorticoids , and of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 , on structural order of human erythrocyte ghost membranes was investigated by determining the steady - state fluorescence anisotropy of diphenylhexatriene ( DPH ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dexamethasone was found to induce a significant decrease in membrane structural order at concentrations of about 10 ( - 6 ) M in a concentration - dependent manner .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found a correlation between the uptake of dexamethasone by the ghost membranes and the decrease in the structural order .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The other glucocorticoids tested , methylprednisolone and corticosterone , were also effective at concentrations of 10 ( - 5 ) M or greater .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We observed no change in membrane structural order with RU 486 up to a concentration of 10 ( - 4 ) M .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thus , the glucocorticoid - induced membrane perturbation , the possibility to inhibit it by RU 486 , and the inactivity of the structurally related progesterone , refer to relatively specific binding sites for the glucocorticoids in the membrane of erythrocyte ghosts .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Mutation of tyrosines 492 / 493 in the kinase domain of ZAP - 70 affects multiple T - cell receptor signaling pathways .,O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O O B I I I O O O
We overexpressed in the Jurkat T - cell line ZAP - 70 mutated on Tyr - 492 and Tyr - 493 in the putative regulatory loop of its kinase domain .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
This mutant inhibited TCR - induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells by interfering with both intracellular calcium increase and Ras - regulated activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases .,O O O B O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I I O
"Moreover , TCR - induced phosphorylation of pp36 - 38 , thought to play a role upstream of these pathways , was found to be reduced .",O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , overexpression of wild - type ZAP - 70 induced constitutive activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells .",O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I I I I O
The ZAP - 70 mutant studied here could be phosphorylated on tyrosine when associated to the TCR zeta chain and was able to bind p56 ( lck ) .,O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I O
This result demonstrates that Tyr - 492 and Tyr - 493 are not responsible for the Src homology domain 2 - mediated association of p56 ( lck ) with ZAP - 70 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O
"Our data are most consistent with a model in which recruitment to the TCR allows ZAP - 70 autophosphorylation and binding to p56 ( lck ) , which in turn phosphorylates Tyr - 492 and / or Tyr - 493 with consequent up - regulation of the ZAP - 70 kinase activity .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
Effects of glucocorticoids on lymphocyte activation in patients with steroid - sensitive and steroid - resistant asthma .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Glucocorticoids are important medications used to control the airway inflammation associated with asthma .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Synthetic glucocorticoids vary in their binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor ( GCR ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"METHODS : We compared hydrocortisone , beclomethasone dipropionate , triamcinolone acetonide , flunisolide , and budesonide with regard to their capacity to inhibit phytohemagglutinin - induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation from six patients with steroid - sensitive asthma and seven patients with steroid - resistant asthma .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"RESULTS : Dose - dependent inhibition was demonstrated for all glucocorticoids in both patient groups , with the steroid - resistant group requiring approximately 2 log - fold more glucocorticoids for an equivalent degree of inhibition .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The mean concentrations necessary to cause 50 % inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50s ) for the steroid - sensitive group ranged from 2 x 10 ( - 10 ) mol / L for budesonide to 7 x 10 ( - 8 ) mol / L for hydrocortisone , whereas the mean IC50s for the steroid - resistant group ranged from approximately 2 x 10 ( - 8 ) mol / L for budesonide to greater than 10 ( - 6 ) mol / L for hydrocortisone .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , a significant correlation was noted between the degree of inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation ( IC50 ) and the binding affinity of dexamethasone to the GCR .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Patients with steroid - resistant asthma have been shown to have a reduced GCR binding affinity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
"CONCLUSION : These data suggest that glucocorticoids such as budesonide , by virtue of their high GCR binding affinities and greater ability to suppress lymphocyte proliferation , may therefore be beneficial in the management of difficult - to - control asthma .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 plays an important role in regulating cell - cycle progression .,O B I I I I B O O O O O O O O O O O
p27Kip1 directly inhibits the catalytic activity of cyclin / cdks ( cyclin - dependent kinase ) complexes and / or interferes physically with cyclin / cdks activation by CAK .,B O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I O O B O
"Interestingly , the expression level of p27Kip1 mRNA was maximal in resting Go T - cells and rapidly declined following anti - CD3 activation .",O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
We report here the cloning of p27Kip1 gene from murine genomic DNA and the functional analysis of the promoter of the p27Kip1 gene .,O O O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O O O O O B O O
"The promoter region lacked a TATA box but contained potential binding sites for the transcriptional factors including two Sp1 , CRE , Myb and NFkB located at positions - 153 , - 178 , - 286 , - 875 , and - 1011 , respectively .",O B I O O B I O O O O O O O B I O O B O B O B O B O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O
"To analyze the regulatory mechanisms controlling p27Kip1 gene expression , we characterized the 5 ' - flanking region from nt - 1609 to + 178 .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I I I I O
Nuclear NF - ATp is a hallmark of unstimulated B cells from B - CLL patients .,B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
B lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) were analysed for the nuclear presence and DNA binding of a panel of transcription factors which are involved in the gene control of lymphoid cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
"The following transcription factors were studied : the Octamer factors Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 , members of the AP - 1 factor family , NF - AT factors , in particular NF - ATp , and members of the Rel / NF - kB family .",O O B I O O O O B I B I I O B I I O O O O B I I I I O B I I I O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I I I O
"We show that the constitutive nuclear translocation of NF - ATp , a member of the growing family of NF - AT factors , is a hallmark of nonstimulated B cells from CLL patients that distinguishes B - CLL cells from ' normal ' B lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Constitutive binding of further factor proteins to DNA , such as JunD , c - Fos and FosB , was detected in several patients whereas the localisation and DNA binding of other factors such as c - Jun , RelA / p65 and c - Rel was unaltered .",O O O O B I O O O O O B O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O B I I O O O
It is remarkable that in B - CLL cells the nuclear appearance and DNA binding of specific transcription factors is dramatically affected whereas other members of the same factor family remained unaltered in these leukemic cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
"It remains to be shown which molecular events lead to the specific ' pre - activation ' , i . e .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Naive ( CD45RA + ) T lymphocytes are more sensitive to oxidative stress - induced signals than memory ( CD45RO + ) cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Formation of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROI ) after oxidative stress has been shown to be an activation signal for T lymphocytes , e . g . , expression of IL - 2 and its receptor are induced .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B O O O
"These ROI - induced effects can , to a large extent , be attributed to the activation of the transcription factor NF - kappaB .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I O
Now we have examined whether naive and memory T lymphocytes differ in their sensitivity to ROI - mediated signals .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"When CD45RA + ( naive ) and CD45RO + ( memory ) T lymphocytes were directly stimulated with H2O2 , NF - kappaB nuclear translocation was stronger in naive cells than in memory cells and it could be induced with lower doses .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The composition of the induced nuclear NF - kappaB ( levels of p50 and RelA proteins ) was similar in these cell types .,O O O O O B I I I O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O
"The magnitude and kinetics of intracellular ROI were similar , suggesting that there were no differences in ROI - forming mechanisms or antioxidative capacities .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The probable regulatory point was the cytoplasmic IkappaB inhibitor : in CD45RA + cells , H2O2 caused a more profound depression in the levels of IkappaB alpha .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Rapid shuttling of NF - AT in discrimination of Ca2 + signals and immunosuppression .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Cells need to distinguish between transient Ca2 + signals that induce events such as muscle contraction , secretion , adhesion and synaptic transmission , and sustained Ca2 + signals that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The latter class of events is blocked in lymphocytes by the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 , which inhibit calcineurin , a Ca2 + - activated serine / threonine phosphatase necessary for the nuclear import of NF - AT transcription factors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I B I O
"Here we report that sustained high concentrations of Ca2 + , but not transient pulses , are required to maintain NF - AT transcription factors in the nucleus , where they participate in Ca2 + - dependent induction of genes required for lymphocyte activation and proliferation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Thus a primary effect of these immunosuppressive reagents is to control the subcellular localization of the NF - AT family of transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I O
Autoregulation of the NF - kappa B transactivator RelA ( p65 ) by multiple cytoplasmic inhibitors containing ankyrin motifs .,O O O B I I I I B O B O O O B I O B I O
"RelA ( p65 ) functions as the critical transactivating component of the heterodimeric p50 - p65 NF - kappa B complex and contains a high - affinity binding site for its cytoplasmic inhibitor , I kappa B alpha .",B O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O B I I I I O O B I O B I I I O
"After cellular activation , I kappa B alpha is rapidly degraded in concert with the induced nuclear translocation of NF - kappa B .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
The present study demonstrates that tumor necrosis factor alpha - induced degradation of I kappa B alpha in human T cells is preceded by its rapid phosphorylation in vivo .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , these effects on I kappa B alpha result in nuclear mobilization of only a fraction of the entire cytoplasmic pool of RelA .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Subsequent studies have revealed that ( i ) cytoplasmic RelA is stably associated not only with I kappa B alpha but also with other ankyrin motif - rich proteins including the products of the NF - kappa B2 ( p100 ) and NF - kappa B1 ( p105 ) genes ; ( ii ) in contrast to RelA - I kappa B alpha , RelA - p100 cytoplasmic complexes are not dissociated following tumor necrosis factor alpha activation ; ( iii ) p100 functions as a potent inhibitor of RelA - mediated transcription in vivo ; ( iv ) the interaction of RelA and p100 involves the conserved Rel homology domain of both proteins but not the nuclear localization signal of RelA , which is required for I kappa B alpha binding ; ( v ) p100 inhibition of RelA function requires the C - terminal ankyrin motif domain , which mediates cytoplasmic retention of RelA ; and ( vi ) as observed with I kappa B alpha , nuclear RelA stimulates p100 mRNA and protein expression .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B B I I I I O B I I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B O O B O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B O B I O O O O

Increased levels of replication of the HIV type 1 are observed after the activation of infected T cells through the TCR .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"However , anti - CD45 antibodies inhibit these effects in cells from infected individuals .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we examined interrelationships between CD45 and HIV - 1 further .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
We measured effects on the HIV - 1 LTR in T cell lines that were stimulated with antibodies against CD45 and in those that lacked the expression of CD45 on their surfaces .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O
"Second , T cells , which lack CD45 and can not signal via the TCR , supported higher levels of viral replication and gene expression .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
This was due to the presence of active NF - kappa B complexes in the nucleus of CD45 - T cells .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B O O O O

Calcineurin potentiates activation of the granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor gene in T cells : involvement of the conserved lymphokine element 0 .,B O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O
Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) are produced by stimulation with phorbol - 12 - myristate acetate ( PMA ) and calcium ionophore ( A23187 ) in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells .,B I I I I I I O B I I O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Earlier studies on the IL - 2 gene expression showed that overexpression of calcineurin ( CN ) , a Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein phosphatase , can stimulate transcription from the IL - 2 promoter through the NF - AT - binding site .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O B O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I I O
"In this study , we obtained evidence that transfection of the cDNAs for CN A ( catalytic ) and CN B ( regulatory ) subunits also augments transcription from the GM - CSF promoter and recovers the transcription inhibited by CsA .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
We also found that the active CN partially replaces calcium ionophore in synergy with PMA to induce expression of endogenous GM - CSF and IL - 2 .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O
"By multimerizing the regulatory elements of the GM - CSF promoter , we found that one of the target sites for the CN action is the conserved lymphokine element 0 ( CLE0 ) , located at positions between - 54 and - 40 .",O O O B I O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O

NF - CLE0 gamma binding is induced by PMA / A23187 and is inhibited by treatment with CsA .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These results suggest that CN is involved in the coordinated induction of the GM - CSF and IL - 2 genes and that the CLE0 sequence of the GM - CSF gene is a functional analogue of the NF - AT - binding site in the IL - 2 promoter , which mediates signals downstream of T cell activation .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O B I O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O

The Bcd proto - oncogene was activated by a truncation in the 5 ' UTR .,O B B I I O O O O O O O B I I O
Predicted peptide sequence of ORF2 contained a zinc finger domain which showed significant homology to GC box binding proteins BTEB2 and SP1 .,B I I O B O O B I I O O O O O B I I I B O B O
Transfection of an expression vector containing ORF2 but not full length cDNA was able to transform NIH3T3 cells and induce tumors in nude mice .,O O O B I O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bcd mRNA transcripts of < or = 2 . 6 kb were selectively expressed in PBL and testis of healthy individuals .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Within the PBL , Bcd gene expression was restricted to CD19 + B - cells and absent from CD14 + monocytes and T - cells .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bcd transcripts were detected in all normal PBL samples tested but not in several malignant human B - cell lines and not in 50 % of B - cells from B - CLL patients .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Expression of Egr - 1 correlates with the transformed phenotype and the type of viral latency in EBV genome positive lymphoid cell lines .,O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Thus , constitutive activation of Egr - 1 gene is invariably associated with unrestricted expression of viral latent genes in all group III EBV genome carrying cell lines .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , Egr - 1 expression is abrogated in group I Burkitt tumor cells , irrespective of the EBV genome carrying status .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
Activated viral gene expression associated with phenotypic conversion of group I cell lines in to group II or III restores the Egr - 1 gene expression .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
"Finally , time course analysis of Egr - 1 expression during the early steps of EBV infection in vitro demonstrated that Egr - 1 is upregulated within minutes from the initial interaction with the B lymphocyte .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Expression of erythroid - specific genes in megakaryoblastic disorders .,O O B I I I O O O O

Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( AML - M7 ) and transient myeloproliferative disorder in Down ' s syndrome ( TMD ) are characterized by rapid growth of abnormal blast cells which express megakaryocytic markers .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"These blast cells express lineage - specific transcription factors such as GATA - 1 common to these lineages and frequently express erythroid - specific mRNAs such as gamma - globin and erythroid delta - aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS - E ) , indicating that most of the blasts in M7 and TMD cases have erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes .",O O O O B I I I I O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I O B I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Stat3 recruitment by two distinct ligand - induced , tyrosine - phosphorylated docking sites in the interleukin - 10 receptor intracellular domain .",B O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O B I I I I I O
Recent work has shown that IL - 10 induces activation of the JAK - STAT signaling pathway .,O O O O O B I I O O O O B B I O O O
"To define the mechanism underlying signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) protein recruitment to the interleukin 10 ( IL - 10 ) receptor , the STAT proteins activated by IL - 10 in different cell populations were first defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays .",O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O B I I I I I I I O O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IL - 10 also activated Stat5 in Ba / F3 cells that stably expressed the murine IL - 10 receptor .,B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Twelve amino acid peptides encompassing either of these two tyrosine residues in phosphorylated form coprecipitated Stat3 but not Stat1 and blocked IL - 10 - induced Stat3 phosphorylation in a cell - free system .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O B O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , tyrosine - phosphorylated peptides containing Tyr374 or Tyr396 did not interact with Stat3 or block Stat3 activation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
These data demonstrate that Stat3 but not Stat1 or Stat5 is directly recruited to the ligand - activated IL - 10 receptor by binding to specific but redundant receptor intracellular domain sequences containing phosphotyrosine .,O O O O B O O B O B O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O
A switch from human fetal ( gamma ) - to adult ( beta ) - globin expression occurs within erythroid precursor cells of the adult lineage .,O O O B I I I I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Previously we and others showed by targeted gene disruption that the zinc finger gene , erythroid Kruppel - like factor ( EKLF ) , is required for expression of the beta - globin gene in mice , presumably through interaction with a high - affinity binding site in the proximal promoter .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I O

Impaired silencing of gamma - globin expression identifies EKLF as the first transcription factor participating quantitatively in the gamma - globin to beta - globin switch .,O O O B I I O O B O O O B I O O O O B I I O B I I O O
Our findings are compatible with a competitive model of switching in which EKLF mediates an adult stage - specific interaction between the beta - globin gene promoter and the locus control region that excludes the gamma - globin gene .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I O O O B I I I O

"Addition of the - 176 to - 96 sequence to the 4X NF - AT - Oct construct did not impart the ability to be affected by anergy , but addition of the - 236 to - 96 sequence did , demonstrating that anergy is an active inhibitory process and that more than the presence of the - 150 AP - 1 binding site ( - 152 to - 147 ) is required to mediate the effect .",O O O B I I I I I O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O
Mutational studies of the - 236 to - 96 sequence indicated that the presence of both the - 130 AP - 1 - like site ( - 187 to - 181 ) and the - 150 proximal AP - 1 site were necessary to observe anergy .,O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O B I I I I O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O

Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of erythroid gene expression in anthracycline - induced differentiation of human erythroleukemic cells .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
Aclacinomycin ( ACLA ) and doxorubicin ( DOX ) were used at subtoxic concentrations to induce erythroid differentiation in the human leukemic cell line K562 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"By using run - on assays , ACLA was shown to induce an enhancement of the transcription of erythroid genes , including gamma - globin , PBGD , erythropoietin receptor , and GATA - 1 transcription factor .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I O B O B I O O B I I B I O
"In contrast , in DOX - treated cells , the transcription rate of these genes was unchanged in comparison with control cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"In addition , inhibition of mRNA synthesis with actinomycin D indicated that DOX induced an increased stability of PBGD and GATA - 1 mRNAs , whereas ACLA did not affect the half - lives of these mRNAs .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O

Interleukin - 7 ( IL - 7 ) stimulates the proliferation of normal and leukemic B and T cell precursors and T lymphocytes .,B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Activation of the JAK / STAT pathway has been implicated in IL - 7R signaling .,O O O B B I O O O O O B I I O O
We investigated which STAT complexes are formed upon stimulation of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( BCP - ALL ) cells with IL - 7 .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Gel retardation assays with STAT - binding oligonucleotides showed that IL - 7 induces the formation of two major STAT complexes in BCP - ALL cells .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
Supershifts with anti - STAT antibodies identified these as STAT1 and STAT5 complexes .,O O O O O O O O O B O B I O
"IL - 7 also induced STAT / DNA binding in BCP - ALL cases that failed to proliferate in response to IL - 7 , suggesting that the ability of IL - 7R to activate the JAK / STAT pathway per se is not sufficient for proliferation induction .",B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O B B I O O O O O O O O O O
Activation of the chimeric G - CSF - R / IL - 7R alpha with G - CSF resulted in a full proliferative response and induced the phosphorylation of JAK1 but not JAK2 .,O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O

"These findings establish that STAT1 and STAT5 , and possibly STAT3 , are activated upon stimulation of precursor B cells with IL - 7 .",O O O O B O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
The data further indicate that the IL - 7R alpha chains are directly involved in the activation of JAKs and STATs and have a major role in proliferative signaling in precursor B cells .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stimulation of human lymphocyte proliferation and CD40 antigen expression by phosphorothioate oligonucleotides complementary to hepatitis B virus genome .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O

The cytotoxic properties of monocytes were not influenced by the oligos .,O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings indicate that antisense oligos against hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) have mitogenic effects on the proliferation of human lymphocytes in a non - specific manner and may activate T cells to express CD40 antigen .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Activation protein 1 - dependent transcriptional activation of interleukin 2 gene by Ca2 + / calmodulin kinase type IV / Gr .,B I I O O O O O B I I O B I I I I I I I I O
"The Ca2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ( CaMK ) type IV / Gr is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes and is activated after signaling via the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , indicating that it mediates some of the Ca ( 2 + ) - dependent transcriptional events that follow TCR engagement .",O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O

CaMKIV / Gr signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of c - fos but is independent of p21ras or calcineurin .,B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B O B O

These results reveal a central role for CaMKIV / Gr as a Ca ( 2 + ) - regulated activator of gene transcription in T lymphocytes .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IL - 12 - induced activation of NK and T cells occurs in the absence of immediate - early activation gene expression .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O
"The responses of lymphocytes to IL - 2 and IL - 12 , involving proliferation , differentiation , and cytokine production , are only partially overlapping , and may depend on induced differential expression of specific sets of genes .",O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Using reverse - transcription PCR differential display , we isolated an mRNA species expressed in IL - 2 - but not IL - 12 - stimulated NK cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Analysis of the accumulation of mRNA - encoding members of the AP - 1 transcription factor family demonstrated that c - fos and junB are also expressed upon stimulation of NK and T cells with IL - 2 , but not IL - 12 , whereas expression of c - jun and junD is not modified by either cytokine .",O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I I O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O B I I O B O O O O O B O
"Accordingly , increased AP - 1 DNA - binding activity and AP - 1 - dependent transcriptional activity were detected exclusively in IL - 2 - stimulated cells .",O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Analysis of the expression of genes reported to regulate cytokine - induced proliferation demonstrated that both IL - 2 and IL - 12 induce c - myc mRNA accumulation in NK and T cells , whereas only IL - 2 induces bcl - 2 expression .",O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O B I I O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O

Active suppression of the class II transactivator - encoding AIR - 1 locus is responsible for the lack of major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression observed during differentiation from B cells to plasma cells .,O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study the genetic control of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II gene expression during the transition from B cell to plasma cell has been analyzed .,O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Class II molecules are not expressed in plasma cells because of an active suppression resulting in the abrogation of class II gene transcription .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"We show here that the plasma cell - specific repressor function , designated SIR ( suppressor of immune response genes ) , does not act directly on the transcription of class II genes , but instead on the transcription of the AIR - 1 gene , whose product , the class II transactivator ( CIITA ) , is fundamental for the regulation of the constitutive and inducible expression of MHC class II genes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
This was unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that plasmacytoma x B cell hybrids carrying an AIR - 1 locus derived from CIITA - expressing cells do not express CIITA - specific transcripts .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Transfection of a cDNA containing the human CIITA coding sequence under the control of an heterologous promoter restores expression of human MHC class II genes in the hybrids and is responsible for de novo expression of mouse MHC class II genes in both the mouse plasmacytoma cell line and the hybrids .,O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
These results confirm and extend the notion of the functional conservation of the AIR - 1 gene product across species barriers .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O
"Interestingly , in CIITA - transfected cell hybrids , cell surface expression of the human HLA - DQ heterodimer was not observed .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O

"These findings further support our previous observations on the distinct regulation of expression of the human HLA - DQ class II subset , which may be thus controlled at the posttranscriptional level by a CIITA - independent mechanism .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Requirements for induction of vitamin D - mediated gene regulation in normal human B lymphocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Mature human lymphocytes are unique targets of 1 alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) in that vitamin D receptors ( VDR ) are not constitutively expressed , and specific cellular activation signals are required for both the up - regulation of VDR and establishment of reactivity to the lipophilic ligand .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"Treatment of B lymphocytes with the cytokine IL - 4 ( IL - 4 ) , in the absence of prior activation , induces a weak up - regulation of VDR expression but fails to generate vitamin D - responsive element ( VDRE ) - reactive nuclear protein complexes or to initiate the genomic transcription of 25 - hydroxyvitamin D3 24 - hydroxylase .",O O O O O O B B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"Stimulation of B lymphocytes by either ligation of CD40 Ag or cross - linking the Ig receptor is also insufficient to render B lymphocytes responsive to 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"In the presence of 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 , cellular activation associated with stimulation of such a progression appears to be sufficient for the up - regulation of VDR message and protein and necessary for the establishment of VDRE binding complexes and the induction of 24 - hydroxylase message .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O
"Furthermore , biologic functions are modulated , in that the hormone inhibits proliferation in a subset of the activated B cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The human T - cell leukemia virus type 1 posttranscriptional trans - activator Rex contains a nuclear export signal .,O B I I I I I I I I I I I B O O B I I O

Modulation of the expression of the IFN - gamma receptor beta - chain controls responsiveness to IFN - gamma in human peripheral blood T cells .,O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O
IFN - gamma has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in T cells that are important in determining T cell development and polarized differentiation .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Therefore , any event that enables T cells to become less responsive to IFN - gamma may potentially alter immune responsiveness to Ag .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O
"In this work , we show that human peripheral blood T cells that are stimulated through the TCR and expanded with IL - 2 are unresponsive to IFN - gamma , as determined by a lack of activation of jak kinases and the transcription factor , STAT1 ( alpha ) , a signal transducer and activator of transcription .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O

"Although transcriptional factors AP - 1 and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT ) are important for the normal induction of IL - 2 , it is unknown if the age - related decline in IL - 2 production by activated human T cells may be associated with aberrancies in transcriptional regulatory proteins .",O B I B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

The IL - 2 enhancer contains a functional motif named CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) that serves a role as a target for mitogenic T cell activation signals .,O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The CD28RE sequence reveals similarity to the consensus kappaB binding motif .,O B O O O O O B I I I O
Here we demonstrate that CD28RE binds an inducible protein with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa called nuclear factor of mitogenic - activated T cells ( NF - MATp35 ) that is clearly different from the known NF - kappaB / Rel family members .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"Induction of NF - MATp35 was shown to depend on de novo protein synthesis and was restricted to T cells that received a mitogenic combination of T cell stimuli , not necessarily including CD28 signaling .",O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Nonmitogenic T cell stimulation did not result in appearance of NF - MATp35 .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Similar to its effect on IL - 2 production , cyclosporin A inhibited the induction of NF - MATp35 .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Taken together , these data demonstrate that the nuclear appearance of NF - MATp35 shows excellent correlation with IL - 2 production , which is a unique characteristic among nuclear factors implicated in the control of IL - 2 gene expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
"The work reported here resolves , at the level of gene regulation , the controversy as to whether or not human monocytes / macrophages can produce nitric oxide ( NO ) when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , with or without co - stimulation by interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Studies included structural comparison of the promoters for human and mouse inducible NO synthase ( iNOS ) genes , transfection and assay of human and mouse iNOS promoter regions in response to LPS + / - IFN - gamma , and electrophoretic mobility shift assays of kappa B response elements .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I O
The importance of resolution of this controversy is that future research in this area should be directed toward the understanding of alternative mechanisms that can result in the successful production of NO .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"In addition , dual colour FISH analysis using centromere specific probes for chromosomes X and 17 showed that the breakpoints on both chromosomes lie within the alphoid arrays , making interruption of a locus on either chromosome unlikely .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Identification of a herpesvirus Saimiri cis - acting DNA fragment that permits stable replication of episomes in transformed T cells .,O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Herpesvirus saimiri is a lymphotropic herpesvirus capable of immortalizing and transforming T cells both in vitro and in vivo .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immortalized and transformed T cells harbor several copies of the viral genome as a persisting genome .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O
The mapping of the cis - acting genetic cis - acting segment ( oriP ) required for viral episomal maintenance is reported here .,O O O O B I I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O
Viral DNA fragments that potentially contain oriP were cloned into a plasmid that contains the hygromycin resistance gene .,B I I O O O B O O O O B O O O B I I O
This viral fragment permits stable plasmid replication without deletion or rearrangement as well as episomal maintenance without integration or recombination .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The function of oriP depends on a trans - acting factor ( s ) encoded by the viral genome .,O O O B O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I O
The 1 . 955 - kb viral segment includes a dyad symmetry region located between two small nuclear RNA genes and is located upstream of the dihydrofolate reductase gene homolog .,O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O
"Therefore , this oriP contains novel elements distinct from those of other DNA viruses .",O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
In vivo anergized CD4 + T cells express perturbed AP - 1 and NF - kappa B transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I B I O
Anergy is a major mechanism to ensure antigen - specific tolerance in T lymphocytes in the adult .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In vivo , anergy has mainly been studied at the cellular level .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we used the T - cell - activating superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A ( SEA ) to investigate molecular mechanisms of T - lymphocyte anergy in vivo .",O O O O O O O B I I I I I B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Injection of SEA to adult mice activates CD4 + T cells expressing certain T - cell receptor ( TCR ) variable region beta - chain families and induces strong and rapid production of interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"In contrast , repeated injections of SEA cause CD4 + T - cell deletion and anergy in the remaining CD4 + T cells , characterized by reduced expression of IL - 2 at mRNA and protein levels .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
"We analyzed expression of AP - 1 , NF - kappa B , NF - AT , and octamer binding transcription factors , which are known to be involved in the regulation of IL - 2 gene promoter activity .",O O O O B I I O B I I I O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
"In contrast , anergic CD4 + T cells contained severely reduced levels of AP - 1 and Fos / Jun - containing NF - AT complexes but expressed significant amounts of NF - kappa B and Oct binding proteins after SEA stimulation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O B I I I O B I I O B O O
"Resolution of the NF - kappa B complex demonstrated predominant expression of p50 - p65 heterodimers in activated CD4 + T cells , while anergic cells mainly expressed the transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer .",O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
These alterations of transcription factors are likely to be responsible for repression of IL - 2 in anergic T cells .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
Stimulation through the Fas / APO - 1 receptor results in apoptosis through an incompletely characterized signaling pathway .,O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"It has been shown that TCR stimulation requires both the membrane tyrosine phosphatase , CD45 , and the Src - family kinase , Lck , to result in cellular activation .",O O O O O B O O O O B I I O B O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O
"Further , in normal and CD45 - or Lck - deficient cell lines , Fas stimulation results in activation of Jun kinase ( JNK ) , a proposed mediator of stress activation pathways .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O
Previous studies have also demonstrated a role for endogenous ceramide release in Fas - mediated apoptosis .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We show that stimulation with a synthetic ceramide analog results in JNK activation as well as apoptosis , suggesting ceramide release occurs proximal to JNK activation in Fas signaling .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O
"Our data suggest that although CD45 and Lck are not required for Fas signaling , JNK activation may play an important role transducing distal signals that lead to apoptosis after Fas ligation .",O O O O O B O B O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In vivo protein - DNA interactions of the human beta - globin locus in erythroid cells expressing the fetal or the adult globin gene program .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O

"In the locus control region ( LCR ) of the beta - globin locus , in vivo footprints on NF - E2 ( or AP - 1 ) and GATA - 1 motifs remained the same regardless of whether the fetal or the adult globin genes are expressed .",O O B I I O B O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
"In promoter regions , the actively transcribed genes demonstrated extensive and consistent footprints over the canonical elements , such as CACCC and CCAAT motifs .",O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"The adult globin expressing cells displayed more extensive footprints than the fetal globin expressing cells in the 3 ' regulatory sequences of both the Agamma - and the beta - globin genes , suggesting a role of these 3 ' elements in beta - globin gene expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O
"Our results suggest that the bulk of protein - DNA interactions that underlies the developmental control of globin genes takes place in the gamma - and beta - globin gene promoters , and that GT motifs of the beta - globin locus LCR may play a role in the developmental regulation of human beta - globin gene expression , perhaps by increasing the probability of interaction of the LCR holocomplex with the fetal or the adult globin gene .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O B I O O B I I I B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I I I O

A 2 - kb VDR cDNA insert ( including the complete VDR coding region ) was cloned in an antisense orientation into the EBV episomal vector pMEP4 under the control of an inducible promoter and transfected into U937 .,O B I I I I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O

"Human T lymphotropic virus - I infection of human T lymphocytes induces expression of the beta - galactoside - binding lectin , galectin - 3 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O
Animal lectins play important roles in a variety of biological processes via their recognition of glycoconjugates .,O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Galectin - 3 is a beta - galactoside - binding lectin previously designated as epsilon BP ( IgE - binding protein ) , CBP35 , Mac - 2 , L - 29 , and L - 34 , and its expression has been associated with various physiological and pathological processes , including cell growth , tumor transformation , and metastasis .",O O O O O B I I I I I O O O B I O B I I I O O B O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

IL - 10 cooperates with TNF - alpha to activate HIV - 1 from latently and acutely infected cells of monocyte / macrophage lineage .,B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IL - 10 is elevated in HIV - 1 - infected individuals and has been implicated in disease progression .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we investigated the effects of IL - 10 on the activation of HIV - 1 from infected monocytes and macrophages .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Although IL - 10 alone did not induce HIV - 1 replication , in the presence of TNF - alpha , IL - 10 markedly enhanced virion production from a chronically infected promonocytic cell line ( U1 ) and in acutely infected monocyte - derived macrophages .",O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neutralizing mAbs to IL - 10 and TNF - alpha indicated that both cytokines were essential for the induction and were required to generate a synergistic increase in virus expression .,O B O B I I O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The human T - cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV - I ) has been etiologically associated with the development of the adult T - cell leukemia ( ATL ) as well as degenerative neurologic syndrome termed tropical spastic paraparesis ( TSP ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HTLV - I encodes a potent transactivator protein termed Tax that appears to play an important role in the process of T - cell immortalization .,O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Even though the mechanisms by which Tax induces transformation are still unknown , it seems likely that the ability of Tax to alter the expression of many cellular genes plays an important part in this process .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Tax does not bind directly to DNA but rather deregulates the activity of cellular transcription factors .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
One family of host transcription factors whose activity is altered by Tax includes NF - kappa B / Rel .,O O O B I I O O O O O B O B I I I I I O
These transcription factors are post - transcriptionally regulated by their assembly with a second family of inhibitory proteins termed I kappa B that serve to sequester the NF - kappa B / Rel complexes in the cytoplasm .,O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O
"Upon cellular activation , I kappa B alpha is phosphorylated , polyubiquitinated , and degraded in the proteasome .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B O

"Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A induces serine / threonine phosphorylation , subcellular redistribution , and functional inhibition of STAT3 .",O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) are rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to cytokine and growth factor stimulation of cell surface receptors .,B I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O B I I O
STATs hereafter are translocated to the nucleus where they act as transcription factors .,B O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Recent reports suggest that serine phosphorylation of STATs also is involved in the regulation of STAT - mediated gene transcription .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O

Signal transduction pathways triggered by the FcepsilonRIIb receptor ( CD23 ) in human monocytes lead to nuclear factor - kappaB activation .,O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O B I I I O O
BACKGROUND : Alveolar macrophages play a key role in the initiation of the inflammatory reaction of allergic asthma .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes are activated when IgE / allergen immune complexes bind to the CD23 receptor , which leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O B I O O O O O O O B I O
METHODS : CD23 was cross - linked in human monocytes and U937 cells with IgE immune complexes .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

"Transcription factor activation and gene transcription were studied by gel - shift assays and Northern blot analysis , respectively .",B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RESULTS : Nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB is the main transcription factor involved in the gene activation that follows CD23 cross - linking in monocytes .,O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
CD23 - induced NF - kappaB is a heterodimer composed of p65 / p50 subunits .,B I I I I I O O O O O B I I I O
NF - kappaB nuclear translocation is secondary to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the NF - kappaB inhibitory molecule IkappaBalpha .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I B O
"Tyrosine kinase - dependent , and not protein kinase C - dependent , pathways mediate CD23 - triggered NF - kappaB activation but do not participate in the direct phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha .",B I O O O O O B I I O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O
IkappaBalpha degradation and NF - kappaB nuclear translocation correlate with transcriptional activation of the inflammatory cytokines TNF - alpha and IL - 1beta .,B O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I B I I O O O O O

Suppression of TNFalpha - mediated NFkappaB activity by myricetin and other flavonoids through downregulating the activity of IKK in ECV304 cells .,O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
"Flavonoids are a group of naturally - occurring phenolic compounds in the plant kingdom , and many flavonoids are found with vascular protective properties .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nevertheless how the protective response is exerted by flavonoids is not well characterized .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In view of the nuclear factor - kappaB ( NFkappaB ) may play a central role in the initiation of atherosclerosis , prevention of the activation of NFkappaB represents an important role in protecting vascular injury .",O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , the effects of flavonoids on NFkappaB / inhibitor - kappaB ( IkappaB ) system in ECV304 cells activated with tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNFalpha ) were examined .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O
"We investigated the inhibitory action of six flavonoids on IkappaB kinase ( IKK ) activity , an enzyme recently found to phosphorylate critical serine residues of IkappaB for degradation .",O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Of six flavonoids tested , myricetin was found to strongly inhibit IKK kinase activity , and prevent the degradation of IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta in activated endothelial cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O
"Furthermore , myricetin was also found to inhibit NFkappaB activity correlated with suppression of monocyte adhesion to ECV304 cells .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O

Bcl - 2 - mediated drug resistance : inhibition of apoptosis by blocking nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes ( NFAT ) - induced Fas ligand transcription .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O B O O O
"Bcl - 2 inhibits apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli , including chemotherapy drugs and glucocorticoids .",B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is generally accepted that Bcl - 2 exerts its antiapoptotic effects mainly by dimerizing with proapoptotic members of the Bcl - 2 family such as Bax and Bad .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B O B O
"However , the mechanism of the antiapoptotic effects is unclear .",O O O O O O O O O O O
We have found that Bcl - 2 overexpression leads to the prevention of chemotherapy ( paclitaxel ) - induced expression of FasL and blocks paclitaxel - induced apoptosis .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
"The mechanism of this effect is that Bcl - 2 prevents the nuclear translocation of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes , a transcription factor activated by microtubule damage ) by binding and sequestering calcineurin , a calcium - dependent phosphatase that must dephosphorylate NFAT to move to the nucleus .",O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B O B I I I I I O O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
"Thus , it appears that paclitaxel and other drugs that disturb microtubule function kill cells at least in part through the induction of FasL .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Furthermore , Bcl - 2 antagonizes drug - induced apoptosis by inhibiting calcineurin activation , blocking NFAT nuclear translocation , and preventing FasL expression .",O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O B O O

"Using antigen peptide analogs with different mutations of known DQ2 - anchor residues , T cell response was reduced in an peptide - affinity and - concentration specific manner .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The decrease using weaker binding peptides was gradual as stimulation with a peptide with intermediate affinity yielded intermediate T cell proliferation and the poorest binding peptide induced an even weaker T cell response .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"MHC class II density on the APC was modified using DQ2 homo - and heterozygous B - LCLs as APCs , however this variation of MHC concentration had no effect on T cell proliferation .",B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"These in vivo anti - inflammatory effects of IL - 11 were associated with reduced NF - kappaB activation in lung , reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluids , and diminished up - regulation of lung vascular ICAM - 1 .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
"It is interesting that IL - 11 did not affect BAL fluid content of the CXC chemokines , macrophage inflammatory protein - 2 ( MIP - 2 ) and cytokine - inducible neutrophil chemoattractant ( CINC ) ; the presence of IL - 11 did not affect these chemokines .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I I O B I I O O B I I I I O B O O O O O B I I O O O O B O

The requirement for TNF is further confirmed by the observation that the inability of the intermediate CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( - ) thymocytes to replicate the virus is associated with a defect in TNF production during their interaction with TEC and correlates with the absence of nuclear NF - kappaB activity in these freshly isolated thymocytes .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
Addition of exogenous TNF to the intermediate thymocyte cultures induces NF - kappaB activity and is sufficient to promote HIV replication in the cocultures with TEC .,O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Together , these data suggest that in vivo , despite an efficient entry of the virus in all the CD4 ( + ) subpopulations , a high viral load may be generated exclusively within the mature CD4 ( + ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( + ) subset of thymocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

NF - kappaB - mediated up - regulation of Bcl - x and Bfl - 1 / A1 is required for CD40 survival signaling in B lymphocytes .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O B O O O O O O
Many of the effects of CD40 are believed to be achieved through altered gene expression .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O

Inhibition of the NF - kappaB pathway by overexpression of a dominant - active inhibitor of NF - kappaB abolished CD40 - induced up - regulation of both the Bfl - 1 and Bcl - x genes and also eliminated the ability of CD40 to rescue Fas - induced cell death .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O

"However , stimulation with MBP did not produce an increase in the binding activity of nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB or activator protein - 1 .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B I I I O
No NF - IL - 6 binding activity was detected in the same nuclear extracts .,O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , stimulation with MBP prolonged the stability of IL - 8 mRNA .",O O O O O B O O O O B I I I O
"These findings indicate that MBP is selective among the eosinophil granule proteins as a stimulus for neutrophil IL - 8 release and , further , that stimulation of neutrophil IL - 8 release by MBP involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation .",O O O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O

"By using Jurkat and primary human T lymphocytes , we demonstrate that the simultaneous activation of two second messengers of the TCR - initiated signal transduction , protein kinase C ( PKC ) and calcineurin , results in the synergistic activation of the IkappaBalpha kinase ( IKK ) complex but not of another putative IkappaBalpha kinase , p90 ( rsk ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O B O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I O B I I I O

The human B29 gene lacks either a TATA or a CAAT box and transcription is initiated at multiple sites .,O O B I O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I O
The minimal promoter of the human B29 gene is contained within a 193 - bp region 5 ' of these multiple start sites .,O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I O

Thus increased expression of GCRbeta could account for glucocorticoid insensitivity .,O O O O B O O O O O O
Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were examined for GCRbeta immunoreactivity using a GCRbeta - specific antibody by immunohistochemical staining .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I I O O O O
Cell localization of GCRbeta expression was performed using a double immunostaining technique .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O

Activation of the Janus kinase 3 - STAT5a pathway after CD40 triggering of human monocytes but not of resting B cells .,O O O B I I B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O

These results suggest that the activation signals in human B cells and monocytes differ following CD40 stimulation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O

Erythropoietin ( EPO ) and its receptor ( EPOR ) are required for the development of mature erythrocytes .,B O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
"After binding of ligand , the EPOR activates a variety of signaling pathways that ultimately control cellular proliferation , survival , and specific gene expression .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Although erythroid progenitors appear to be the principal EPO - responsive cell type in vivo due to the restricted expression of the EPOR , many growth factor - dependent cell lines expressing the EPOR can respond to EPO by activating many or all of these pathways .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"In the present study , we have identified a cellular context ( the interleukin - 2 [ IL - 2 ] - dependent HT - 2 line ) in which the EPO stimulation of the EPOR fails to support cellular proliferation , STAT - 5 induction , or MAPK activation , despite efficient phosphorylation of the EPOR and JAK2 and inhibition of apoptosis after withdrawal of IL - 2 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O B I I O

This is due to alternative splice / polyadenylation events that lead to the predominant synthesis of two long isoforms in naive T cells and a shorter NF - ATc isoform in effector T cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O

This Delta19 beta - catenin mutant localizes to the nucleus because it may not be efficiently sequestered in the cytoplasm .,O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The nuclear localization of Delta19 definitively demonstrates that the mechanisms by which beta - catenin localizes in the nucleus are completely independent of LEF / TCF factors .,O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O

To test whether disordered memory T cell differentiation contributes to the typical Th1 - dominated chronic inflammation in RA we investigated differentiation of resting CD4 + memory T cells in patients with early ( 6 wk to 12 mo ) untreated RA and in age - and sex - matched healthy controls in vitro .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No difference in cytokine secretion profiles of freshly isolated memory T cells was detected between patients and controls .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Marked differences were found in response to priming .,O O O O O O O O O
Th2 cells could be induced in all healthy controls by priming with anti - CD28 in the absence of TCR ligation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B O O
"By contrast , priming under those conditions resulted in Th2 differentiation in only 9 of 24 RA patients .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Exogenous IL - 4 could overcome the apparent Th2 differentiation defect in seven patients but was without effect in the remaining eight patients .,O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In all patients a marked decrease in IL - 2 - producing cells and a significant increase in well - differentiated Th1 cells that produced IFN - gamma but not IL - 2 were evident after priming with anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O B I I O B I I O
The data suggest that CD4 + memory T cells from patients with early untreated RA manifest an intrinsic abnormality in their ability to differentiate into specific cytokine - producing effector cells that might contribute to the characteristic Th1 - dominated chronic ( auto ) immune inflammation in RA .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The intracellular parasite Theileria parva protects infected T cells from apoptosis .,O O O O O O O O O O O O
Parasites have evolved a plethora of strategies to ensure their survival .,O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The intracellular parasite Theileria parva secures its propagation and spreads through the infected animal by infecting and transforming T cells , inducing their continuous proliferation and rendering them metastatic .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In previous work , we have shown that the parasite induces constitutive activation of the transcription factor NF - kappaB , by inducing the constitutive degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I O O O O O O O O B I O
"The biological significance of NF - kappaB activation in T . parva - infected cells , however , has not yet been defined .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cells that have been transformed by viruses or oncogenes can persist only if they manage to avoid destruction by the apoptotic mechanisms that are activated on transformation and that contribute to maintain cellular homeostasis .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We now demonstrate that parasite - induced NF - kappaB activation plays a crucial role in the survival of T . parva - transformed T cells by conveying protection against an apoptotic signal that accompanies parasite - mediated transformation .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Consequently , inhibition of NF - kappaB nuclear translocation and the expression of dominant negative mutant forms of components of the NF - kappaB activation pathway , such as IkappaBalpha or p65 , prompt rapid apoptosis of T . parva - transformed T cells .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Genetic variation in cytokine promoter regions is postulated to influence susceptibility to infection , but the molecular mechanisms by which such polymorphisms might affect gene regulation are unknown .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Through systematic DNA footprinting of the TNF ( encoding tumour necrosis factor , TNF ) promoter region , we have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) that causes the helix - turn - helix transcription factor OCT - 1 to bind to a novel region of complex protein - DNA interactions and alters gene expression in human monocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The OCT - 1 - binding genotype , found in approximately 5 % of Africans , is associated with fourfold increased susceptibility to cerebral malaria in large case - control studies of West African and East African populations , after correction for other known TNF polymorphisms and linked HLA alleles .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
UV - induced CYP1A1 gene expression in human cells is mediated by tryptophan .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Induction of cytochrome P - 4501A1 ( CYP1A1 ) activity by UV has been observed earlier in animal studies via a mechanism that has not yet been resolved .,O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our previous data have indicated that formylated indolocarbazoles which are formed by UV irradiation of tryptophan solutions are very potent Ah - receptor agonists .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To evaluate the effect of UV light on cytochrome P4501A1 gene expression , we studied the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA by UV irradiation of cultured human keratinocytes ( HaCaT cell line ) , primary human blood lymphocytes and mouse Hepa - 1 cells .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The cells were exposed to UV light delivered by a bank of 6 Philips TL20 / 12RS sun lamps emitting primarily in the UVB range in the absence and presence of tryptophan .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A semiquantitative reverse transcriptase - linked polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) was used for analysis of gene expression in the treated cells .,O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To find out if the induction by UV light is caused by the formation of an Ah receptor ligand , Hepa - 1 wild - type and Ah receptor deficient c12 cell lines were applied .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Together , these results indicate that UV - induced CYP1A1 gene expression in mammalian cells is mediated by an Ah receptor ligand formed from tryptophan .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
Here we show that the lymphoid lineage - determining factors Ikaros and Aiolos can function as strong transcriptional repressors .,O O O O O B I I I I B O B O O O B I I O
This function is mediated through two repression domains and is dependent upon the promoter context and cell type .,O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
Repression by Ikaros proteins correlates with hypo - acetylation of core histones at promoter sites and is relieved by histone deacetylase inhibitors .,O O B I O O O O O O B I O B I O O O O B I O O
"Consistent with these findings , Ikaros and its repression domains can interact in vivo and in vitro with the mSin3 family of co - repressors which bind to histone deacetylases .",O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I O
"Based on these and our recent findings of associations between Ikaros and Mi - 2 - HDAC , we propose that Ikaros family members modulate gene expression during lymphocyte development by recruiting distinct histone deacetylase complexes to specific promoters .",O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I O
"Protein kinase B ( c - Akt ) , phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase , and STAT5 are activated by erythropoietin ( EPO ) in HCD57 erythroid cells but are constitutively active in an EPO - independent , apoptosis - resistant subclone ( HCD57 - SREI cells ) .",B I I O B I I O O B I I I O O B O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found that erythropoietin ( EPO ) and stem cell factor ( SCF ) activated protein kinase B ( PKB / Akt ) in EPO - dependent HCD57 erythroid cells .,O O O B O B O O B I I O B O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Constitutive activations of PKB / Akt , STAT5a , and STAT5b were noted in these EPO - independent cells .",O O O B I I O B O O B O O O O O O O O O
PI3 - kinase activity was an upstream activator of PKB / Akt because the PI3 - kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked both constitutive PKB / Akt and factor - dependent PKB / Akt activity .,B I I O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O
"The LY294002 study showed that proliferation and viability of both HCD57 - SREI and HCD57 cells correlated with the activity of PKB / Akt ; however , PKB / Akt activity alone did not protect these cells from apoptosis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Treatment of HCD57 cells with SCF also activated PKB / Akt , but did not protect from apoptosis .",O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O
This result suggested that PKB / PI3 - kinase activity is necessary but not sufficient to promote viability and / or proliferation .,O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Constitutive STAT5 activity , activated through an unknown pathway not including JAK2 or EPOR , may act in concert with the constitutive PI3 - kinase / PKB / Akt pathway to protect the EPO - independent HCD57 - SREI cells from apoptosis and promote limited proliferation .",O B O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B I I B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Disruption of alpha beta but not of gamma delta T cell development by overexpression of the helix - loop - helix protein Id3 in committed T cell progenitors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I B O O O O O O
"Here we document that overexpression of Id3 , in progenitors that have initiated TCR gene rearrangements ( pre - T cells ) , inhibits development into TCRalpha beta but not into TCRgamma delta T cells .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , Id3 impedes expression of recombination activating genes and downregulates pre - Talpha mRNA .",O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I O
These observations suggest possible mechanisms by which Id3 overexpression can differentially affect development of pre - T cells into TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also observed that cell surface CD4 ( - ) CD8 ( - ) CD3 ( - ) cells with rearranged TCR genes developed from Id3 - transduced but not from control - transduced pre - T cells in an FTOC .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that bHLH factors are required to control T cell development after the T / NK developmental checkpoint .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HIV - 1 infects resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) but remains inactive state until subsequent cell activation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have demonstrated that the cross - linking of cell surface CD4 by gp120 - anti - gp120 immune complexes or heat - inactivated HIV - 1 ( iHIV - 1 ) is sufficient to trigger activation signals leading to virus reactivation ( 9 ) .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we demonstrate that NF - kappaB nuclear translocation and stimulation of virus production by iHIV - 1 were strictly linked to the concentrations of viral proteins used as exogenous stimuli .",O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
"Moreover , we further investigated the physiologic relevance of these observations .",O O O O O O O O O O O O
"When submitted to an in vitro CD4 cross - linking by iHIV - 1 , PBMCs from HIV - 1 - infected patients were found to produce virus .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This viral reactivation was associated with increased NF - kappaB nuclear translocation in patients ' PBMCs .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
"Finally , soluble CD4 ( sCD4 ) prevented virus reactivation by D1 / CDR2 - loop ligands .",O O B I O B O O O O O B I I I I I O
"Among host immune factors , the cytokine TNF - alpha has previously been shown to increase HIV - 1 replication in various monocyte and T cell model systems .",O O O O O O B B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Here , we demonstrate that signaling through the TNF receptor family member , the lymphotoxin - beta ( LT - beta ) receptor ( LT - betaR ) , also regulates HIV - 1 replication .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , HIV - 1 replication is cooperatively stimulated when the distinct LT - betaR and TNF receptor systems are simultaneously engaged by their specific ligands .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O
"Moreover , in a physiological coculture cellular assay system , we show that membrane - bound TNF - alpha and LT - alpha1beta2 act virtually identically to their soluble forms in the regulation of HIV - 1 replication .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thus , cosignaling via the LT - beta and TNF - alpha receptors is probably involved in the modulation of HIV - 1 replication and the subsequent determination of HIV - 1 viral burden in monocytes .",O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Intriguingly , surface expression of LT - alpha1beta2 is up - regulated on a T cell line acutely infected with HIV - 1 , suggesting a positive feedback loop between HIV - 1 infection , LT - alpha1beta2 expression , and HIV - 1 replication .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
Monoclonal anti - endothelial cell antibodies from a patient with Takayasu arteritis activate endothelial cells from large vessels .,B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"OBJECTIVE : To create monoclonal anti - endothelial cell antibodies ( mAECA ) from a patient with Takayasu arteritis to evaluate their ability to activate human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) , and to characterize the mechanism of EC activation .",O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Activity against macrovascular EC ( HUVEC ) and microvascular EC ( human bone marrow EC immortalized by SV40 ) antigens was detected by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Inhibition studies were used to select the monoclonal antibodies ( mAECA ) which share the same EC epitope binding specificity as the total IgG - AECA from the Takayasu arteritis patient .,O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O
The binding of the mAECA to human aortic EC was studied by immunohistochemistry .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"The activated EC were examined for the adherence of a monocytic cell line ( U937 ) , as well as for expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 , and E - selectin .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I I O
"RESULTS : Six mAECA were selected , the mixture of which produced 100 % inhibition of binding of the original IgG ( from the patient with Takayasu arteritis ) to HUVEC .",O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
"All mAECA possessed high activity against macrovascular EC , but none had significant antimicrovascular EC activity .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 4 mAECA induced EC expression of adhesion molecules and increased adhesion of U937 monocytic cells to EC .,O O B O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , these mAECA stimulated the nuclear translocation of the NF - kappaB transcription factor .",O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I O
"CONCLUSION : Our findings suggest that AECA may directly stimulate EC in Takayasu arteritis through elevation of adhesion molecule expression associated with NF - kappaB activation and adhesion of monocytes , and may therefore play a pathogenic role in the development of the vasculopathy in Takayasu arteritis .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cutting edge : expression of the NF of activated T cells in eosinophils : regulation by IL - 4 and IL - 5 .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I I O B I I O
"We report that NF - AT1 and NF - AT4 are expressed cytoplasmically in resting eosinophils , whereas NF - AT2 and NF - AT3 have not been seen .",O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O
"Likewise , NF - AT1 mRNA and NF - AT4 mRNA have been detected in resting eosinophils , and their levels can be significantly up - regulated by the Th2 - associated cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 5 .",O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I B I I O B I I O
There is no detectable NF - AT protein expression in the nuclei of resting eosinophils .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Only NF - AT1 and NF - AT4 , but not NF - AT2 and NF - AT3 , have translocated into the nuclei in IL - 4 - or IL - 5 - stimulated eosinophils .",O B I I O B I I O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These findings delineate a novel pathway in the cytokine network in which Th2 lymphocytes ` ` control ' ' eosinophils via the release of IL - 4 and IL - 5 , and activation of NF - AT in eosinophils .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O B I I O O O

PPARalpha activators inhibit cytokine - induced vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 expression in human endothelial cells .,O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Adhesion molecule expression on the endothelial cell ( EC ) surface is critical for leukocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Better understanding of transcriptional regulation of adhesion molecules in ECs may provide important insight into plaque formation .,O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
"Peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha ( PPARalpha ) , a member of the nuclear receptor family , regulates gene expression in response to certain fatty acids and fibric acid derivatives .",B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The present study investigated PPARalpha expression in human ECs and their regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O
METHODS AND RESULTS : Immunohistochemistry revealed that human carotid artery ECs express PPARalpha .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Pretreatment of cultured human ECs with the PPARalpha activators fenofibrate or WY14643 inhibited TNF - alpha - induced VCAM - 1 in a time - and concentration - dependent manner , an effect not seen with PPARgamma activators .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Transient transfection of deletional VCAM - 1 promoter constructs and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that fenofibrate inhibits VCAM - 1 transcription in part by inhibiting NF - kappaB .,O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O
"Finally , PPARalpha activators significantly reduced adhesion of U937 cells to cultured human ECs .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"CONCLUSIONS : Human ECs express PPARalpha , a potentially important regulator of atherogenesis through its transcriptional control of VCAM - 1 gene expression .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
"NF - ATc , an inducibly expressed transcription factor , controls gene expression in T lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes .",B I I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
"We show here that the transcriptional co - activators CBP / p300 bind to and control the activity of the inducible N - terminal transactivation domain of NF - ATc , TAD - A .",O O O O O B I I I B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O B I I O
"Similar to the N terminal transactivation domain of c - Jun , TAD - A is inducibly phosphorylated , but this phosphorylation is dispensable for the interaction with CBP / p300 .",O O O B I I I O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Constitutive active versions of c - Raf and Rac synergistically enhance the CBP / p300 - mediated increase of TAD - A activity , indicating the important role CBP / p300 plays in the integration of T cell activation signals .",O O O O B I I O B O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Since a mutation of CBP abolishing HAT activity is almost as active as wild - type CBP in T cells , functions of CBP / p300 other than histone acetylation appear to control the NF - AT - dependent transcription in T cells .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
"Immune functions , clinical parameters and hormone receptor status in breast cancer patients .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A possible correlation between immune and clinical parameters was analysed in 50 breast cancer patients .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Immune parameters , natural killer cell and T lymphocyte functions and the numbers of circulating T lymphocytes were analysed against the clinical parameters comprising the tumour burden , the stage of the disease and the expression of hormone receptors on the tumour .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
"In order to analyse the immune function data effectively , low responders were identified with stringent cut - off values .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Considerably higher proportions of low responders were found among the patient population .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Latent membrane protein 1 of Epstein - Barr virus interacts with JAK3 and activates STAT proteins .,B I I I O O O O O O O B O O B I O
Latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) acts like a permanently activated receptor of the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - receptor superfamily and is absolutely required for B cell immortalization by Epstein - Barr virus .,B I I I O B O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Molecular and biochemical approaches demonstrated that LMP1 usurps cellular signaling pathways resulting in the induction of NF - kappaB and AP - 1 via two C - terminal activating regions .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I I I O
We demonstrate here that a third region encompassing a proline rich sequence within the 33 bp repetitive stretch of LMP1 ' s C - terminus is required for the activation of Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B O O
The interaction of LMP1 and JAK3 leads to the enhanced tyrosine auto / transphosphorylation of JAK3 within minutes after crosslinking of a conditional NGF - R : LMP1 chimera and is a prerequisite for the activation of STAT transcription factors .,O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O
These results reveal a novel activating region in the LMP1 C - terminus and identify the JAK / STAT pathway as a target of this viral integral membrane protein in B cells .,O O O O O O O O O B B I I O O O B B I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
Monocyte arrest and transmigration on inflamed endothelium in shear flow is inhibited by adenovirus - mediated gene transfer of IkappaB - alpha .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

"We found that overexpression of IkappaB - alpha in endothelial cells using a recombinant adenovirus prevented tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) - induced degradation of IkappaB - alpha and suppressed the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) , and E - selectin mRNA and surface protein expression and the upregulation of transcripts for the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP - 1 ) and growth - related activity - alpha ( GRO - alpha ) by TNF - alpha .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O B I I I I O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B B I I I O B I I O O B I I I I I O B I I O O B I I O
Inhibition with monoclonal antibodies and peptide antagonists inferred that this was due to reduced expression of Ig integrin ligand as well as of chemokines specifically involved in these events .,O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
"Thus , our data provide novel evidence that selective modulation of NF - kappaB by adenoviral transfer of IkappaB - alpha impairs the expression of multiple endothelial gene products required for subsequent monocyte arrest and emigration in shear flow and thus for monocyte infiltration in atherosclerotic plaques .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recognition of NFATp / AP - 1 composite elements within genes induced upon the activation of immune cells .,O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
Composite elements are regulatory modules of promoters or enhancers that consist of binding sites of two different but synergizing transcription factors .,B I O B I O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B I O
A well - studied example is nuclear factors of activated T - cell ( NFAT ) sites which are composite elements of a NFATp / c and an activating protein 1 ( AP - 1 ) binding site .,O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O
We have developed a computational approach to identify potential NFAT target genes which ( a ) comprises an improved method to scan for individual NFAT composite elements ; ( b ) considers positional effects relative to transcription start sites ; and ( c ) involves cluster analysis of potential NFAT composite elements .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"All three steps progressively helpX ? ed to discriminate T - cell - specific promoter sequences against other functional regions ( coding and intronic sequences ) of the same genes , against promoters of muscle - specific genes or against random sequences .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O B I O B I I I O O O O O O O B O B I I I O O B I O

Phorbol ester - induced mononuclear cell differentiation is blocked by the mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibitor PD98059 .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O O
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway contributes to 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) - induced mononuclear differentiation in the human myeloblastic leukemia ML - 1 cells .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Glucocorticoid receptors in anorexia nervosa and Cushing ' s disease .,B I O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Patients with anorexia nervosa do not display cushingoid features in spite of elevated cortisol plasma levels .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whether a cortisol resistance or a reduced availability of the metabolic substrates necessary to develop the effect of glucocorticoids is responsible for this has not been established .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Glucocorticoid receptor characteristics were examined on mononuclear leukocytes by measuring [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding and the effect of dexamethasone on [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation , which represents an index of DNA synthesis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Conversely , glucocorticoid receptor affinity was significantly decreased in anorexia nervosa as well as in Cushing ' s patients compared to control subjects ( dissociation constant 4 . 0 + / - 0 . 31 and 4 . 1 + / - 0 . 34 vs . 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 29 nmol / L , p < . 001 ) and inversely correlated with the levels of urinary free cortisol in both groups of patients .",O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Basal [ 3H ] thymidine incorporation in MNL was significantly reduced in anorexia nervosa as well as in Cushing ' s patients compared to control subjects ( p < . 001 ) and was diminished by dexamethasone to an extent similar to control subjects in patients with anorexia nervosa , but significantly ( p < . 001 ) less in those with Cushing ' s disease .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS : These data indicate that the lack of cushingoid features in patients with anorexia nervosa is not ascribable to a reduced sensitivity to glucocorticoids but is more likely due to the paucity of metabolic substrates .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs inhibit the expression of cytokines and induce HSP70 in human monocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O

"As HSF1 can function as both an activator of heat shock genes and a repressor of non - heat shock genes such as IL1B and c - fos , we have examined the potential role of HSF1 in the effects of NSAIDs on gene expression in a human monocytic cell line THP - 1 .",O B O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"At least in the case of the IL1B promoter , repression did not seem to involve another factor whose activity is affected by the NSAIDs , NFkappaB as the IL1B promoter fragment used in our studies is not NFkappaB responsive and binds specifically to HSF1 .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O B O

"In addition , only a subset of the NSAIDs induced HSP70 mRNA species .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
These findings reflect the properties of HSF1 which can be activated to at least two DNA binding forms only one of which activates heat shock promoters and suggest that individual NSAID family members may differentially induce one or other of these forms .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Overall therefore , exposure to NSAIDs leads to a profound switch in gene expression in monocytic cells , with suppression of genes involved in macrophage activation and induction of stress genes and HSF1 appears to play a regulatory role in these effects .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O

"In EBV infection most of the changes , including the early induction of cyclin D2 , are dependent on expression of EBV genes , but an alteration in the E2F - 4 profile was partly independent of viral gene expression , presumably occurring in response to signal transduction activated when the virus binds to its receptor , CD21 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O

Cloning of the 5 ' and 3 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) of human keratinocyte PCD / DCoH revealed that it has 53 bp more of GC - rich 5 ' untranslated sequence than the published liver PCD / DCoH .,O O O B I I I I I I O B O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I I I O

Induction of apoptosis of mononucleated cells is a physiological process for regulating the intensity of the immune response .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The female steroid hormones estrogen ( E2 ) and progesterone ( Prog ) are known to modulate the reactivity of the immune system ; recently it has been demonstrated that they can regulate induction of apoptosis of endothelial cells and osteoblasts .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
TNF - alpha - mediated induction of apoptosis has been well characterized in myeloid cells .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated whether E2 and Prog could interfere with TNF - alpha - induced apoptosis of the monoblastoid U937 cell line .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Treatment with E2 or Prog increased survival and prevented apoptosis induced by TNF - alpha in both undifferentiated and macrophage - like PMA - differentiated U937 cells , as assessed by trypan blue exclusion cell counting , thymidine incorporation , AnnexinV labeling , followed by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation studies .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This effect can be associated with the activation of specific hormone receptors , since we observed the expression of the estrogen receptor alpha ( ER - alpha ) , ER - beta , and progesterone receptor ( PR ) mRNAs ; the ER - alpha protein expression was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O

"Other steroid receptor drugs such as Raloxifene , RU486 , or the ICI 182 , 780 in PMA - differentiated cells displayed agonist activity by preventing TNF - alpha - induced apoptosis as efficiently as the hormones alone , providing further evidence to the notion that steroid receptor drugs may manifest agonist or antagonist activities depending on the cellular context in which they are studied .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Efforts to pinpoint the exact site of action and specificity of HePTP in the signaling cascade revealed that HePTP acts directly on the mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinases Erk1 and 2 and consequently reduces the magnitude and duration of their catalytic activation in intact T cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I I I I I B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Recently , it was shown that suppression of T cell - mediated immune responses by cyclosporin A ( CyA ) enhanced atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , aspirin was found to lower the risk of myocardial infarction in men .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

These observations correlated with the modulation of NF - kappaB activity in EC .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O

These data provide the molecular basis for the notion that ( 1 ) part of the anti - atherogenic effect of aspirin may be due to the prevention of the adhesion of sensitized T cells to stressed EC ; ( 2 ) that part of the atherosclerosis - promoting effect of CyA may be due to its potential as an inducer of Hsp60 expression and its inability to down - regulate adhesion molecule expression on EC ; and ( 3 ) that down - regulation of MCP - 1 expression by aspirin may result in decreased recruitment of monocytes into the arterial intima beneath stressed EC .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"In contrast to the negative autoregulation of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) expression seen in most cells and tissues , GR expression is positively autoregulated in human leukemic T cells and in other cells sensitive to glucocorticoid - induced cell death .",O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To determine whether positive autoregulation is a necessary component of glucocorticoid - induced cell death , a wild - type GR gene under the control of a tetracycline - regulated promoter was stably transfected into glucocorticoid - resistant cells lacking endogenous functional receptor .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Activation of leukocytes by proinflammatory stimuli selectively initiates intracellular signal transduction via sequential phosphorylation of kinases .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulation of human neutrophils is known to result in activation of p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPk ) ; however , the upstream activator ( s ) of p38 MAPk is unknown , and consequences of p38 MAPk activation remain largely undefined .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O O B I O O O O O

"However , although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta ( GSK - 3beta ) , resulting in increased levels of beta - catenin , we find no evidence for involvement of GSK - 3beta in Tcf - mediated transcription in T cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I B I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"That is , a dominant negative GSK - 3beta does not specifically activate Tcf transcription and stimuli ( lithium or phytohemagglutinin ) that inhibit GSK - 3beta activity also do not activate Tcf reporter genes .",O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O
"Thus , inhibition of GSK - 3beta is insufficient to activate Tcf - dependent transcription in T lymphocytes .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This is the first demonstration that lithium can alter gene expression of Tcf - responsive genes , and points to a difference in regulation of Wnt signaling between fibroblasts and lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

SIT is a disulfide - linked homodimeric glycoprotein that is expressed in lymphocytes .,B O O B I I I I O O O O O O
After tyrosine phosphorylation by src and possibly syk protein tyrosine kinases SIT recruits the SH2 domain - containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 via an immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibition motif .,O O O O B O O B B I I B O O B I I I I I B O O O O O O O O O

"In the present study we investigated the possible involvement of the mitogen - activated protein kinase family members extracellular - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) and c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) in mediating IL - 6 gene expression in human monocytes , in particular their role in enhancing NF - kappa B activity .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I I I I I O B I I O O O O B I I I I O B O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
"Freshly isolated monocytes treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid secreted high levels of IL - 6 protein , which coincided with enhanced binding activity of NF - kappa B as well as with phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1 / 2 and JNK proteins .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
The ERK pathway - specific inhibitor PD98059 inhibited IL - 6 secretion from monocytes .,O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
Transient overexpression of inactive mutants of either Raf - 1 or JNK1 showed that both pathways were involved in kappa B - dependent IL - 6 promoter activity .,O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
"By using PD98059 , we demonstrated that the Raf1 / MEK1 / ERK1 / 2 pathway did not affect the DNA binding of NF - kappa B but , rather , acted at the level of transcriptional activity of NF - kappa B .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Interestingly , it was shown that NF - kappa B - mediated gene transcription , both in the context of the IL - 6 promoter as well as on its own , was dependent on both serine kinase activity and interaction with c - Jun protein .",O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
We conclude that okadaic acid - induced IL - 6 gene expression is at least partly mediated through the ERK1 / 2 and JNK pathway - dependent activation of NF - kappa B transcriptional capacity .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O B I I I O O O
Our results suggest that the JNK pathway may regulate NF - kappa B - mediated gene transcription through its phosphorylation and activation of c - Jun .,O O O O O B O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

"These effects were specific in that the potentiated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils was completely blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 , and glucocorticoids did not promote 5 - day M phi ingestion of opsonized erythrocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similar glucocorticoid - mediated potentiation was observed with 5 - day M phi uptake of alternative apoptotic ` ` targets ' ' ( eosinophils and Jurkat T cells ) and in uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by alternative phagocytes ( human glomerular mesangial cells and murine M phi elicited into the peritoneum or derived from bone marrow ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Retinoic acid ( RA ) resistance is a serious problem for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) who are receiving all - trans RA .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The biologic effects of RA are mediated by two distinct families of transcriptional factors : RA receptors ( RARs ) and retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O B O O B I I O B O O

BACKGROUND : We reported on the constitutive interferon - gamma receptor ( IFN - gammaR ) expression on eosinophils .,O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O
But signal transduction through IFN - gammaR on eosinophils remains to be elucidated .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
"In this study , we examined the involvement of the Jak / Stat pathway in the signaling of eosinophils after IFN - gammaR conjugation by the ligand binding .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
METHODS : Purified peripheral eosinophils were stimulated with IFN - gamma at 37 degrees C for 1 - 60 min .,O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
Gel - shift assay was also examined to show the formation of Stat1alpha - DNA complexes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"RESULTS : We show that binding of IFN - gamma to human eosinophils initiated a series of events that resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of not only the IFN - gammaRalpha chain but also Jak1 , Jak2 , and Stat1alpha .",O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B O B O O B O

"The E2A - HLF fusion gene , generated by t ( 17 ; 19 ) ( q22 ; p13 ) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , encodes a chimeric transcription factor in which the trans - activating domains of E2A are fused to the DNA - binding and dimerization domains of hepatic leukemic factor ( HLF ) .",O B I I I I O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I O B O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O B O O

The transgenic mice exhibited abnormal development in the thymus and spleen and were susceptible to infection .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The thymus contained small numbers of thymocytes , and TUNEL staining showed that higher population of thymocytes were undergoing apoptosis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The spleen exhibited a marked reduction in splenic lymphocytes and the flow cytometric analyses and the in vitro colony formation assays showed that the B - cell maturation was blocked at a very early developmental stage .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings indicated that the expression of E2A - HLF induced T - cell apoptosis and B - cell maturation arrest in vivo and that the susceptibility of the transgenic mice to infection was due to immunodeficiency .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) agonist - induced activation of dominant - negative RXR - retinoic acid receptor alpha403 heterodimers is developmentally regulated during myeloid differentiation .,B I I O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The multiple biologic activities of retinoic acid ( RA ) are mediated through RAR and retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) nuclear receptors that interact with specific DNA target sequences as heterodimers ( RXR - RAR ) or homodimers ( RXR - RXR ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I I I O O O O B I I O B O B I I O O B O B I I O O
"RA receptor activation appears critical to regulating important aspects of hematopoiesis , since transducing a COOH - terminally truncated RARalpha exhibiting dominant - negative activity ( RARalpha403 ) into normal mouse bone marrow generates hematopoietic growth factor - dependent cell lines frozen at the multipotent progenitor ( EML ) or committed promyelocyte ( MPRO ) stages .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Nevertheless , relatively high , pharmacological concentrations of RA ( 1 to 10 & mgr ; M ) overcome these differentiation blocks and induce terminal granulocytic differentiation of the MPRO promyelocytes while potentiating interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) - induced commitment of EML cells to the granulocyte / monocyte lineage .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Unexpectedly , we observed that an RXR - specific , rather than an RAR - specific , agonist induces terminal granulocytic differentiation of MPRO promyelocytes , and this differentiation is associated with activation of DNA response elements corresponding to RAR - RXR heterodimers rather than RXR - RXR homodimers .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O B I I I O
"In contrast , in the more immature , multipotent EML cells we observed that this RXR - specific agonist is inactive either in potentiating IL - 3 - mediated commitment of EML cells to the granulocyte lineage or in transactivating RAR - RXR response elements .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
RA - triggered GALdbd - RARalpha hybrid activity in these cells indicates that the multipotent EML cells harbor substantial nuclear hormone receptor coactivator activity .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
"However , the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor trichostatin A readily activates an RXR - RAR reporter construct in the multipotent EML cells but not in the committed MPRO promyelocytes , indicating that differences in HDAC - containing repressor complexes in these two closely related but distinct hematopoietic lineages might account for the differential activation of the RXR - RARalpha403 heterodimers that we observed at these different stages of myeloid development .",O O O B I I I I I O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
The functional synergy between IL - 12 and IL - 2 involves p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase and is associated with the augmentation of STAT serine phosphorylation .,O O O O B I I O B I I O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O

The magnitude of these functional responses is greatly augmented when T cells are activated by the combination of IL - 12 and IL - 2 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O
"Although peripheral blood T cells are largely unresponsive to these cytokines without prior activation , a small subset of CD8 + T cells ( CD8 + CD18bright ) is strongly activated by the combination of IL - 12 and IL - 2 .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O
"In this report we show that the functional synergy between IL - 12 and IL - 2 in CD8 + CD18bright T cells correlates with the activation of the stress kinases , p38 mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase and stress - activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) / Jun N - terminal kinase , but not with the activation of the extracellular signal - regulated kinases .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I I I I I I O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
The functional synergy between IL - 2 and IL - 12 is also associated with a prominent increase in STAT1 and STAT3 serine phosphorylation over that observed with IL - 12 or IL - 2 alone .,O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O
"By contrast , STAT tyrosine phosphorylation is not augmented over that seen with either cytokine alone .",O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase completely inhibits the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 induced by IL - 12 and IL - 2 and abrogates the functional synergy between IL - 12 and IL - 2 without affecting STAT tyrosine phosphorylation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O
This suggests that p38 MAP kinase may play an important role in regulating STAT serine phosphorylation in response to the combination of IL - 12 and IL - 2 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O
"Furthermore , these findings indicate that the optimal activation of T cells by IL - 12 and IL - 2 may depend on an interaction between the p38 MAP kinase and Janus kinase / STAT signaling pathways .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O O

Northern analysis demonstrated increased IL - 2Ralpha gene expression after stimulation with M . tuberculosis which was further induced by interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O
The IL - 2Ralpha promoter containing the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappaB ) site was transcriptionally induced by M . tuberculosis and this NF - kappaB site could confer inducibility to a heterologous herpes thymidine kinase ( TK ) promoter by M . tuberculosis .,O B I I I O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O

Vitamin D receptor 3 ' - untranslated region polymorphisms : lack of effect on mRNA stability .,B I I B I I I I O O O O O O O O O
Allelic variation at the 3 ' - end of the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) gene has been associated with a 3 - 5 - fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer and with differences in bone mineralization .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The work reported here was instigated to identify additional VDR 3 ' - UTR polymorphisms that may have functional significance and to then test whether these genetic variants alter message stability .,O O O O O O O O O B B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Initially , four novel , frequently occurring sequence variants were identified that associated with two common haplotypes that were described previously .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

IL - 2 is required not only for cell cycle progression but also to protect Ag - activated T cells from programmed cell death .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To determine whether either or both of these transcription factors are involved in cell survival or cell cycle progression in response to IL - 2 , primary human T cells responsive to the growth factor were analyzed for NF - kappa B and AP - 1 activation .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The current study clearly demonstrates that IL - 2 does not induce I kappa B alpha degradation or NF - kappa B activation in primary human T cells that respond to IL - 2 by entering the cell cycle and avoiding apoptosis .,O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O

Recent studies from our group suggested that the actions of D3 and retinoids on myelopoiesis also are influenced by endogenous mechanisms involving other steroid hormones .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study we examined the influence of local estrogen metabolism on the differentiation of HL60 cells and normal primitive myeloid progenitor cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We further demonstrated that this change in phosphorylation status correlates with a decrease in DNA binding activity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This modulation of DNA binding activity mediated through the dephosphorylation of DP1 and E2F4 could help to explain the lack of in vivo DNA footprinting in late G1 and S phases of gene promoters negatively regulated through E2F sites and suggests a novel mechanism for controlling E2F transcriptional activity during the transition from quiescence to proliferation .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O

"This observation was further confirmed in a rat air pouch model in vivo , in which both aspirin and triflusal inhibited PGE2 production ( ID50 = 18 . 9 and 11 . 4 mg / kg p . o . , respectively ) but only triflusal - treated animals showed a decrease in COX - 2 expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"This different behavior may be , at least in part , due to the ability of HTB and triflusal to block the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappaB to a higher extent than aspirin and sodium salicylate .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O

We have previously shown that protein kinase C ( PKC ) activation ( with phorbol ester ( PMA ) alone ) specifically induces differentiation of primary human CD34 + hemopoietic progenitor cells ( HPC ) to mature DC .,O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cross - linking of CD44 on rheumatoid synovial cells up - regulates VCAM - 1 .,O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O

"This induction of apoptosis was abolished by the caspase inhibitor zVAD - fmk , correlated with the inhibition of nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - kappaB ) , and was mimicked by a cell permeable inhibitory peptide of NF - kappaB , SN - 50 ; other NF - kappaB inhibitors , curcumin and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ; and the proteasome inhibitor , MG - 132 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"We show here that in circulating monocytes , NF - Y binding activity is not detected on the CCAAT motif present in the promoters of genes such as major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II , gp91 - phox , mig , and fibronectin , whereas during macrophage differentiation , a progressive increase in NF - Y binding activity is observed on these promoters .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
Analysis of NF - Y subunit expression indicates that the absence of NF - Y activity in circulating monocytes is caused by a lack of the A subunit .,O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Furthermore , addition of the recombinant NF - Y A subunit restores NF - Y binding .",O O O O O O B I I B I O B I I O O
We show that the lack of NF - YA protein is due to posttranscriptional regulation and not to a specific proteolytic activity .,O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We thus conclude that the NF - Y A subunit plays a relevant role in activating transcription of genes highly expressed in mature monocytes .,O O O O O B I I B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Interdomain B in ZAP - 70 regulates but is not required for ZAP - 70 signaling function in lymphocytes .,B I O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
The protein tyrosine kinase ZAP - 70 plays an important role in T - cell activation and development .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Paradoxically , removal of interdomain B ( to create the construct designated Delta ) , containing the Y292 , Y315 , and Y319 sites , did not eliminate the ability of ZAP - 70 to induce multiple gene reporters in Syk - deficient DT - 40 B cells and ZAP - 70 / Syk - deficient Jurkat cells .",O O O O B I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we show that Delta still utilizes the same pathways as wild - type ZAP - 70 to mediate NF - AT induction .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O
This is manifested by the ability of Delta to restore induction of calcium fluxes and mitogen - activated protein kinase activation and by the ability of dominant negative Ras and FK506 to block the induction of NF - AT activity mediated by Delta .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B I I O O O B O

"Further studies indicated that inhibition of GTP - cyclohydrolase I ( an enzyme involved in de novo synthesis of an important cofactor for NOS activity , tetrahydrobiopterin ) prevented the generation of NO in A / R - tolerant cells .",O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Extracellular generation of NO ( NO donor ) did not effect the hyperadhesion response induced by the initial A / R challenge .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A / R also induced an oxidant stress in naive HUVECs , but not in A / R - tolerant HUVECs .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Inhibition of NOS during the second A / R insult results in the generation of an oxidant stress similar to that observed after the first A / R challenge .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Taken together , the findings of the present study are consistent with a role for NF - kappaB in the development of A / R tolerance ( with respect to PMN adhesion ) , perhaps by transcriptional regulation of GTP - cyclohydrolase .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
The increased NO production during the second A / R insult reduces PMN adhesion most likely by reducing the intracellular oxidant stress induced by A / R .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mildly oxidized low - density lipoproteins decrease early production of interleukin 2 and nuclear factor kappaB binding to DNA in activated T - lymphocytes .,O O B I I I O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Activated T - lymphocytes are found early in atherosclerosis lesions , but little is known about their role .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Oxidized low - density lipoproteins ( oxLDLs ) are considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the lesions , and we have previously demonstrated that oxLDLs inhibit not only interleukin ( IL ) - 2 - receptor expression on the surface of in vitro - activated T - lymphocytes but also their proliferation .",O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We have now investigated the effect of oxLDLs on blast differentiation , on IL - 2 synthesis and on the activation of the nuclear factor kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) system in activated lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O
Mildly oxLDLs ( 50 and 100 microgram / ml ) decreased the number of lymphoblasts and the level of IL - 2 concentration in the culture supernatants after activation of lymphocytes by phytohaemagglutinin and PMA + ionomycin .,O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"The study of NF - kappaB showed that oxLDLs led to a decrease of activation - induced p65 / p50 NF - kappaB heterodimer binding to DNA , whereas the presence of the constitutive nuclear form of p50 dimer was unchanged .",O O O B I I O O B O O O O O B I I I I I B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
This was correlated with an unchanged level of the active form of the cytosolic inhibitor protein IkappaB - alpha .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I I O

The B29 ( immunoglobulin beta - chain ) gene is a genetic target for early B - cell factor .,O B I I I I I I I O O O O O B I I I I O
Early B - cell factor ( EBF ) is a transcription factor suggested as essential for early B - lymphocyte development by findings in mice where the coding gene has been inactivated by homologous disruption .,B I I I I O B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This makes the identification of genetic targets for this transcription factor pertinent for the understanding of early B - cell development .,O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
"The lack of B29 transcripts , coding for the beta subunit of the B - cell receptor complex , in pro - B cells from EBF - deficient mice suggested that B29 might be a genetic target for EBF .",O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
We here present data suggesting that EBF interacts with three independent sites within the mouse B29 promoter .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O
"Furthermore , ectopic expression of EBF in HeLa cells activated a B29 promoter - controlled reporter construct 13 - fold and induced a low level of expression from the endogenous B29 gene .",O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Finally , mutations in the EBF binding sites diminished B29 promoter activity in pre - B cells while the same mutations did not have as striking an effect on the promoter function in B - cell lines of later differentiation stages .",O O O O O B O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data suggest that the B29 gene is a genetic target for EBF in early B - cell development .,O O O O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Recent molecular evidence points to transient and / or stage - specific expression of delta - and kappa - opioid receptors by thymic and peripheral T lymphocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O
"Since medical treatments or stress commonly increase opioid levels , it is important to understand the mechanisms by which opioids affect T lymphocyte functions .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We therefore created and studied a T cell line expressing the cloned delta - opioid receptor ( DOR1 ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O
"DOR1 ligation by a specific DOR1 agonist , deltorphin , augmented IL - 2 secretion by synergizing with signals from TCR - CD3 and CD28 .",B O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B O
"Although DOR1 signaling increased [ Ca2 + ] i , deltorphin enhanced transcriptional activity of the NF - AT / AP - 1 - binding site via a mechanism independent of calcineurin and distinct from the effects of elevated [ Ca2 + ] i .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Induction of interleukin - 12 p40 transcript by CD40 ligation via activation of nuclear factor - kappaB .,O O B I I B I O B O O O O B I I I O
"Interleukin - 12 is produced in response to infection with bacteria or parasites or to bacterial constituents such as LPS in monocytes / macrophages and dendritic cells , and also generated by the interaction between activated T cells and antigen - presenting cells via CD40 - CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) .",B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O

Sequence analysis of the p40 promoter region identified two potential nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappaB binding sites conserved between mouse and human .,O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that the potential NF - kappaB binding sequence which is located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 genes formed an NF - kappaB complex with nuclear extract from Daudi cells stimulated by CD40 ligation .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I O O B I I O B I I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B O O

These results suggest that the NF - kappaB binding site located around 120 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site in murine and human p40 promoter regions could be important for the p40 induction by CD40 ligation via activation of NF - kappaB .,O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I I O O O O O B O O B O O O O B I I O
High frequency of germ - line BRCA2 mutations among Hungarian male breast cancer patients without family history .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
"To determine the contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations to the pathogenesis of male breast cancer in Hungary , the country with the highest male breast cancer mortality rates in continental Europe , a series of 18 male breast cancer patients and three patients with gynecomastia was analyzed for germ - line mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 .",O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
"Although no germ - line BRCA1 mutation was observed , 6 of the 18 male breast cancer cases ( 33 % ) carried truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O

The first intron acted as a strong transcriptional activator in a position - dependent manner and with no cell - type specificity .,O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The upstream regulatory element could confer T - cell specificity to the GATA - 3 promoter activity , and analysis of this region revealed a 707 - base pair silencer that drastically inhibited GATA - 3 promoter activity in non - T - cells .",O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
We previously reported that the role of reactive oxygen intermediates ( ROIs ) in NF - kappaB activation by proinflammatory cytokines was cell specific .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I O O O O
5 - LOX and 5 - LOX activating protein ( FLAP ) are coexpressed in lymphoid cells but not in monocytic or epithelial cells .,B I I O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IL - 1beta stimulation of epithelial cells did not generate any ROIs and NF - kappaB induction was not influenced by 5 - LOX inhibitors .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O
"However , reintroduction of a functional 5 - LOX system in these cells allowed ROI production and 5 - LOX - dependent NF - kappaB activation .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O
"In monocytic cells , IL - 1beta treatment led to a production of ROIs which is independent of the 5 - LOX enzyme but requires the NADPH oxidase activity .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O

"In conclusion , three different cell - specific pathways lead to NF - kappaB activation by IL - 1beta : a pathway dependent on ROI production by 5 - LOX in lymphoid cells , an ROI - and 5 - LOX - independent pathway in epithelial cells , and a pathway requiring ROI production by NADPH oxidase in monocytic cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
Two variants of the IL - 4R alpha - chain ( IL - 4Ralpha ) gene have been recently identified in association with different atopic disorders .,O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"To clarify the etiological relationship between the two variants , we analyzed responsiveness to IL - 4 of transfectants with four kinds of IL - 4Ralpha carrying either Val or Ile at 50 and either Gln or Arg at 551 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O

A novel growth - factor - dependent myeloid cell line derived from mouse bone marrow cells contains progenitors endowed with high proliferative potential .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We developed mice transgenic for human CSF - 1R because mouse CSF - 1 can not activate human CSF - 1R .,O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O B I I O
Then bone marrow cells from transgenic mice were plated onto MS - 5 stromal cells expressing the membrane form of human CSF - 1 ( 2M - 1 cells ) in order to combine the hematopoietic supporting properties of stromal cells and the proliferative effects of CSF - 1 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

JunB has previously been considered to be a negative regulator of transcription .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O

JunB - control of IL - 4 expression is mediated by the phosphorylation of JunB at Thr102 and - 104 by JNK MAP kinase .,B O O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O
"The synergy between c - Maf and JunB can be attributed to cooperative DNA binding , which is facilitated by JunB phosphorylation .",O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O

Using this approach we first show that reactivities to the immunodominant and subdominant lytic cycle epitopes identified by T cells during primary EBV infection are regularly detectable in the CTL memory of virus carriers ; this implies that in such carriers chronic virus replication remains under direct T - cell control .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Regulation of the human interleukin - 2 gene by the alpha and beta isoforms of the glucocorticoid receptor .,O O O B I I I I O O B I I I O O B I O

"Using a recently developed transfection technique , we demonstrate that in primary human lymphocytes , stimulation of a 548 bp IL - 2 promoter - luciferase reporter construct by phorbol ester and calcium ionophore is reversed by dexamethasone to a similar extent as in Jurkat T lymphoma cells transfected with a GRalpha expression vector .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Transfection of a GRbeta expression vector alone did not result in IL - 2 promoter repression in response to glucocorticoids .,O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O
We conclude that the transrepressive effect of glucocorticoids on IL - 2 gene transcription is exclusively mediated by GRalpha .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B O

We found that : ( i ) both CTCF mRNA and protein are down - regulated during terminal differentiation in most cell lines tested ; ( ii ) CTCF down - regulation is retarded and less pronounced than that of c - myc ; ( iii ) CTCF protein is differentially phosphorylated and the phosphorylation profiles depend on the differentiation pathway .,O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Glucocorticoid resistance in the squirrel monkey is associated with overexpression of the immunophilin FKBP51 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Squirrel monkeys are neotropical primates that have high circulating cortisol to compensate for expression of glucocorticoid receptors ( GRs ) with reduced affinity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O
"The low binding affinity of squirrel monkey GR does not result from substitutions in the receptor , because squirrel monkey GR expressed in vitro exhibits high affinity .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
"In an effort to identify this factor , the cellular levels of components of the GR heterocomplex in SML and human lymphocytes ( HL ) were compared .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O

High - level replication of human immunodeficiency virus in thymocytes requires NF - kappaB activation through interaction with thymic epithelial cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
"We have previously demonstrated that interaction of infected thymocytes with autologous thymic epithelial cells ( TEC ) is a prerequisite for a high level of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) replication in thymocytes ( M .

We report here that this activation of HIV replication takes place at the transcriptional level through activation of the Rel / NF - kappaB transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I B I O

The cotransfection of this LTR with a mutated IkappaBalpha molecule formally demonstrates that LTR transactivation is regulated by members of the Rel / NF - kappaB family in thymocytes .,O O O O B O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O

A TATA - like motif was identified immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site .,O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O
Functional analyses of DNA fragments containing the TATA element and the identification of a DNase I - hypersensitive chromatin site ( HS 1 ) in close proximity to the TATA box suggest that the identified TATA motif is important for elk - 1 transcription in vivo .,O O O B I O O B I O O O O O B I I I I I O B I O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O B I I O O O O

The Notch receptor protein was originally identified in Drosophila and is known to mediate cell to cell communication and influence cell fate decisions .,O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Members of this family have been isolated from invertebrates as well as vertebrates .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The first objective of this study was to determine whether human DC mediate in vitro sensitization of naive CD4 + T cells to epitopes of the immediate early 62 ( IE62 ) protein of varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O
The induction of CD4 + T cell proliferative responses to eight synthetic peptides representing amino acid sequences of the VZV IE62 protein was assessed using T cells and DC from VZV - susceptible donors .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The second objective was to compare in vitro responses of naive T cells with responses to VZV peptides induced in vivo after immunization with varicella vaccine .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"T cell proliferation was induced by three peptides , P1 , P4 , and P7 , in 71 - 100 % of the donors tested before and after vaccination using DC as APC .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Two peptides , P2 and P8 , induced naive T cell proliferation less effectively and were also less immunogenic for T cells from vaccinated or naturally immune donors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"T cell recognition of specific peptides was concordant between naive , DC - mediated responses , and postvaccine responses using monocytes as APC in 69 % of comparisons ( p = 0 . 05 ; chi2 ) ; the predictive value of a positive response to an IE62 peptide before immunization for T cell sensitization in vivo was 82 % .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Mechanism of interleukin - 10 inhibition of T - helper cell activation by superantigen at the level of the cell cycle .,O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
We have analyzed the effects of interleukin - 10 ( IL - 10 ) on the entry of quiescent CD4 ( + ) T cells into the cell cycle upon stimulation with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B ( SEB ) .,O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B B I I O B O O
IL - 10 arrested cells at G0 / G1 .,B I I O O O O O O O
"IL - 10 also prevented the upregulation of the G1 cyclins D2 and D3 , proteins necessary for entry and progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle .",B I I O O O O O O B I B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Addition of exogenous IL - 2 to IL - 10 - treated cells significantly reversed the antiproliferative effects of IL - 10 .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Moreover , IL - 10 effects on the early G1 proteins p27 ( Kip1 ) and cyclin D2 were similarly reversed by exogenous IL - 2 .",O O B I I O O O B I I B I I I O B I O O O O O B I I O
"Cell separation experiments suggest that IL - 10 can effect purified CD4 ( + ) T cells directly , providing functional evidence for the presence of IL - 10 receptors on CD4 ( + ) T cells .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"IL - 10 also inhibited expression of IL - 2 transcriptional regulators c - fos and c - jun , which also inhibit other cell functions .",B I I O O O O B I I I I B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O
Our studies show that the mechanism of IL - 10 regulation of quiescent CD4 ( + ) T - cell activation is mainly by blocking induction of IL - 2 that is critical to downregulation of p27 ( Kip1 ) and upregulation of D cyclins in T - cell activation and entry into the cell cycle .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
IFN - gamma and IL - 10 inhibit induction of IL - 1 receptor type I and type II gene expression by IL - 4 and IL - 13 in human monocytes .,B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O
The Th2 - type cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 13 induce expression of a distinct subset of genes in human monocytes .,O B I I I B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

"IFN - gamma has been shown to inhibit induction of CD23 and 15 - lipoxygenase in monocytes ; however , the effects of IFN - gamma on type I and type II IL - 1R gene expression have not been defined .",B I I O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We examined the effects of IFN - gamma on both basal and IL - 4 / IL - 13 - induced IL - 1R gene expression in primary monocytes .,O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O
"Furthermore , the ability to suppress IL - 1RI and IL - 1RII mRNA levels was not unique to IFN - gamma because IL - 10 also inhibited expression of these genes in IL - 4 / IL - 13 - stimulated monocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Inhibition of IL - 1R gene expression by IFN - gamma and IL - 10 was not due to down - regulation of surface IL - 4R because pretreatment with these cytokines did not decrease the number of IL - 4 binding sites per cell .,O O B I I I O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
"However , suppression of IL - 1R gene expression by IFN - gamma and IL - 10 was associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the IL - 4 / IL - 13 - inducible transcription factor , Stat6 , suggesting a potential mechanism by which IFN - gamma and IL - 10 may mediate their suppressive effects .",O O O O B I I I O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O
"These findings demonstrate that certain cytokines , including IFN - gamma and IL - 10 , antagonize the ability of IL - 4 and IL - 13 to induce increased expression of the IL - 1RI and IL - 1RII genes in monocytes .",O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O
Cytokine rescue from glucocorticoid induced apoptosis in T cells is mediated through inhibition of IkappaBalpha .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"We previously reported that dexamethasone ( DEX ) , a synthetic glucocorticoid , causes apoptosis in mature Th cell lines , and that this induction of cell death is prevented by specific cytokines , namely , by IL - 2 in Th1 cells and by IL - 4 in Th2 cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O
We now show that this differential rescue by specific cytokines in Th cells correlates with the level of IkappaBalpha that is regulated by DEX and cytokines .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O
In both cell types the cellular levels of IkappaBalpha mRNA and protein were evaluated by DEX treatment .,O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
"Interestingly , the DEX - mediated IkappaBalpha induction was completely inhibited by IL - 2 , but not IL - 4 , in Th1 cells , while the reverse profile was seen in Th2 cells .",O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Our results imply that T cells need to maintain a certain level of NF - kappaB transcriptional activity in order to survive ; up - or down - regulation of nuclear NF kappaB through modulation of IkappaBalpha expression by cytokines or DEX may lead to cell survival or cell death , respectively .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Expression of transcription factor genes after influenza A virus infection .,O O B I I O O O O O O
The underlying mechanisms by which the corresponding genes are transcriptionally initiated after virus infection are still poorly understood .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Activation of NF - kappa B seems to play an important role in the regulation of many proinflammatory cytokine genes , but can not be the only mechanism , since several cytokine genes lack respective binding sites in their promoter regions .",O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O O B I O
"Therefore , we additionally investigated other transcription factors of possible importance such as CREB , CTF , OTF - 1 , and OTF - 2 .",O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O B O B I I O O B I I O

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with diabetic nephropathy show increased activation of the oxidative - stress sensitive transcription factor NF - kappaB .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I B I I O
Increased oxidative stress and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF - kappaB has been linked to the development of late diabetic complications .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
To determine whether oxidative stress dependent NF - kappaB activation is evident in patients with diabetic nephropathy we used an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay based semiquantitative detection system which enabled us to determine NF - kappaB activation in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells .,O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
We examined 33 patients with diabetes mellitus ( Type I and Type II ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

In a 3 day intervention study in which 600 mg of the antioxidant thioctic acid ( alpha - lipoic acid ) per day were given to nine patients with diabetic nephropathy oxidative stress in plasma samples was decreased by 48 % and NF - kappaB binding activity in ex vivo isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by 38 % .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"The stability of already formed complexed was somewhat different in the HLA - A3 and HLA - Cw * 0702 system : both were more stable at 26 degrees C than at 37 degrees C but while the beta 2 - m and FCS did not influence the stability of the HLA - A3 / peptide complex , they seemed to cause opposite effects in the HLA - Cw * 0702 system ( beta 2 - m stabilized and FCS destabilized the complex ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O

OCA - B is a B - cell - specific coregulator of the broadly expressed POU domain transcription factor Oct - 1 .,B I I O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I I B I I O
"OCA - B associates with the Oct - 1 POU domain , a bipartite DNA - binding structure containing a POU - specific ( POU [ S ] ) domain joined by a flexible linker to a POU homeodomain ( POU [ H ] ) .",B I I O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I O B I I I O O
"It provides a transcriptional activation domain which , unlike Oct - 1 , activates an mRNA - type promoter effectively , and it stabilizes Oct - 1 on the Oct - 1 - responsive octamer sequence ATGCAAAT .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I O O
These properties of OCA - B parallel those displayed by the herpes simplex virus Oct - 1 coregulator VP16 .,O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I I I I B O

Cell cycle progression initiated by interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) in T cells is critical for lymphoproliferation and an immune response .,O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Phosphatidyl inositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) is activated by IL - 2 .,B I I I I O B O O O O B I I O
"However , nuclear targets for PI3K are not known .",O O O O O B O O O O
Here we identify the cell cycle regulator E2F as an IL - 2 target in T lymphocytes and PI3K as the critical signaling pathway .,O O O O B I I B O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O

The Epstein - Barr virus oncogene product latent membrane protein 1 engages the tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated death domain protein to mediate B lymphocyte growth transformation and activate NF - kappaB .,O B I I I I I B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Epstein - Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) is essential for the transformation of B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines .,O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous data are consistent with a model that LMP1 is a constitutively activated receptor that transduces signals for transformation through its carboxyl - terminal cytoplasmic tail .,O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I I O
"One transformation effector site ( TES1 ) , located within the membrane proximal 45 residues of the cytoplasmic tail , constitutively engages tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated factors .",O B I I O B O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"Signals from TES1 are sufficient to drive initial proliferation of infected resting B lymphocytes , but most lymphoblastoid cells infected with a virus that does not express the 155 residues beyond TES1 fail to grow as long - term cell lines .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O
"We now find that mutating two tyrosines to an isoleucine at the carboxyl end of the cytoplasmic tail cripples the ability of EBV to cause lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth , thereby marking a second transformation effector site , TES2 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O
"A yeast two - hybrid screen identified TES2 interacting proteins , including the tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated death domain protein ( TRADD ) .",O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I I I I I I O B O O
"TRADD associated with wild - type LMP1 but not with isoleucine - mutated LMP1 in mammalian cells , and TRADD constitutively associated with LMP1 in EBV - transformed cells .",B O O B I I I O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O
These results indicate that LMP1 appropriates TRADD to enable efficient long - term lymphoblastoid cell outgrowth .,O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O

"Despite their bipotential capacity , these progenitors develop predominantly to T cells in the thymus .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanisms controlling this developmental choice are unknown .,O O O O O O O O O
Here we present evidence that a member ( s ) of the family of basic helix loop helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors determines lineage specification of NK / T cell progenitors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"The natural dominant negative HLH factor Id3 , which blocks transcriptional activity of a number of known bHLH factors , was expressed in CD34 + progenitor cells by retrovirus - mediated gene transfer .",O O B I I I B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Constitutive expression of Id3 completely blocks development of CD34 + cells into T cells in a fetal thymic organ culture ( FTOC ) .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , development into NK cells in an FTOC is enhanced .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thus , the activity of a bHLH transcription factor is necessary for T lineage differentiation of bipotential precursors , in the absence of which a default pathway leading to NK cell development is chosen .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Late gene expression from the Epstein - Barr virus BcLF1 and BFRF3 promoters does not require DNA replication in cis .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
Late gene expression follows and is dependent upon lytic replication of the viral genome .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
We have developed a reporter assay to begin characterizing the mechanisms that regulate late gene expression in Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this model system , the activities of late promoter - reporter fusions are measured following transient transfection into tissue culture cells expressing EBV during different stages of the lytic cycle .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This system faithfully recapitulates late expression patterns from the endogenous virus , implicating specific cis - active sequences in the control of late gene expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
"In addition , these promoters respond only indirectly to the viral immediate - early transactivator , ZEBRA .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O
This indirect response is mediated by other viral or virally induced activities downstream of ZEBRA in the lytic cascade .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"In this system , late gene expression is sensitive to inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase such as phosphonoacetic acid , although the reporters lack a eukaryotic origin of replication and are not replicated under the assay conditions .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Rather , analysis of this system has revealed a trans relationship between late gene expression and viral DNA replication and highlights the indirect and complex link between these two events .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Modulation of mRNA expression of a novel human myeloid - selective CCAAT / enhancer binding protein gene ( C / EBP epsilon ) .,O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O B I I I O O
Human C / EBP epsilon is a newly cloned gene coding for a CCAAT / enhancer binding protein that may be involved in the regulation of myeloid differentiation .,O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Our studies showed that levels of C / EBP epsilon mRNA were markedly increased in NB4 cells ( promyelocytic leukemia line ) , because they were induced by 9 - cis retinoic acid ( 9 - cis RA ) to differentiate towards granulocytes .",O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Accumulation of C / EBP epsilon mRNA occurred as early as 1 hour after exposure of NB4 cells to 9 - cis RA ( 5 x 10 ( - 7 ) mol / L ) ; and at 48 hours , levels were increased by 5 . 1 - fold .",O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dose - response studies showed that 10 ( - 7 ) to 10 ( - 6 ) mol / L 9 - cis RA ( 12 hours ) resulted in peak levels of C / EBP epsilon mRNA ; but even 10 ( - 10 ) mol / L 9 - cis RA increased levels of these transcripts .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"NB4 cells pulse - exposed ( 30 minutes ) to all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , washed , and cultured ( 3 days ) with either dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) or hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) had a prominent increase in levels of C / EBP epsilon mRNA and an increase in granulocytic differentiation , but exposure to either DMSO or HMBA alone had no effect on base levels of C / EBP epsilon and did not induce differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Macrophage - differentiation of NB4 reduced levels of C / EBP epsilon mRNA .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
Nuclear run - off assays and half - life studies showed that accumulation of C / EBP epsilon mRNA by 9 - cis RA was due to enhanced transcription .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , this C / EBP epsilon mRNA accumulation did not require synthesis of new protein factors because 9 - cis RA induced C / EBP epsilon mRNA accumulation in the absence of new protein synthesis .",O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O
"ATRA also induced expression of C / EBP epsilon protein in NB4 cells , as shown by Western blotting .",O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast to the increase of C / EBP epsilon in 9 - cis RA - mediated granulocytic differentiation , the DMSO - induced differentiation of HL - 60 cells down the granulocytic pathway was associated with an initial reduction of C / EBP epsilon mRNA levels .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O

"The modulation by anti - LPS mAbs of mCD14 - mediated LPS uptake was associated with inhibition of LPS - induced nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) translocation and TNF - alpha secretion in CHO - CD14 cells and monocytes , respectively , while mAb enhancement of non - mCD14 - mediated LPS uptake stimulated these activities .",O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O

Four P - like elements are required for optimal transcription of the mouse IL - 4 gene : involvement of a distinct set of nuclear factor of activated T cells and activator protein - 1 family proteins .,O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I I I I O
We previously identified the P sequence as a critical regulatory element of the human IL - 4 promoter .,O O O O B I O O O B I O O B I I I I O
"In the mouse IL - 4 promoter , there are five elements homologous to the human P sequence designated conserved lymphokine element 0 ( CLE0 ) , P , P2 , P3 and P4 .",O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I O B O O B O B O B O B O

Fetal and neonatal lymphocytes are relatively resistant to activation and cytokine production when stimulated either via their T - cell antigen receptors or lectins .,O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I O B O
The molecular mechanism ( s ) responsible for this phenomenon have not been clearly elucidated .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have hypothesized that such defects in fetal / neonatal T - cell activation may be due to lack of expression of the transcriptional regulatory elements required for T - cell activation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O

We demonstrate that mRNAs for all three of these regulatory factors are expressed in fetal blood cells by the 27th week of gestation and in term cord bloods .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Activation of term infant cord blood mononuclear cells with anti - CD3 monoclonal antibodies resulted in up - regulation of both c - jun and c - fos mRNAs within 15 min of stimulation .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B O O O O O O
"However , secretion of IL - 2 by anti - CD3 - stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells was still blunted compared with control cells from adults .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that fetal nucleated blood cells constitutively express important genes for cytokine regulation and are able to increase intracellular accumulation of the mRNAs for these factors in response to anti - CD3 stimulation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O

The nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) group of transcription factors is retained in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells .,O B I I I I I I I I I O B I O O O O O O O O O
NFAT activation is mediated in part by induced nuclear import .,B O O O O O O O O O O
This process requires calcium - dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT caused by the phosphatase calcineurin .,O O O O O O O O B O O O B B O
The c - Jun amino - terminal kinase ( JNK ) phosphorylates NFAT4 on two sites .,O B I I I I I I O B O O B O O O O

Thiol modulation inhibits the interleukin ( IL ) - 1 - mediated activation of an IL - 1 receptor - associated protein kinase and NF - kappa B .,O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O B I I I I I I I O B I I I O
The interleukin - 1 receptor type I ( IL - 1RI ) is associated with other proteins thus forming a complex system by which IL - 1 exerts its various signals .,O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I O O O O O
IL - 1 signaling is commonly accompanied by oxidative processes and is thought to be subject to redox regulation .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Double - stimulation was used to demonstrate that , in a T lymphocytic cell line ( CEM ) , phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) rapidly induced NF - kappa B through a signaling pathway which did not involve reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and was different from the activation triggered by either H2O2 or tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O O
"Since these latter compounds were known to activate NF - kappa B translocation in a redox - sensitive way , we have demonstrated that NF - kappa B activation by PMA was resistant to antioxidant N - acetyl - L - cysteine ( NAC ) and sensitive to kinase inhibitors staurosporine and H7 while activation by H2O2 or TNF - alpha were not .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
Blockade of T - cell activation by dithiocarbamates involves novel mechanisms of inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
Dithiocarbamates ( DTCs ) have recently been reported as powerful inhibitors of NF - kappaB activation in a number of cell types .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
"Given the role of this transcription factor in the regulation of gene expression in the inflammatory response , NF - kappaB inhibitors have been suggested as potential therapeutic drugs for inflammatory diseases .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
We show here that DTCs inhibited both interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) synthesis and membrane expression of antigens which are induced during T - cell activation .,O O O O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"This inhibition , which occurred with a parallel activation of c - Jun transactivating functions and expression , was reflected by transfection experiments at the IL - 2 promoter level , and involved not only the inhibition of NF - kappaB - driven reporter activation but also that of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O
"Accordingly , electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) indicated that pyrrolidine DTC ( PDTC ) prevented NF - kappaB , and NFAT DNA - binding activity in T cells stimulated with either phorbol myristate acetate plus ionophore or antibodies against the CD3 - T - cell receptor complex and simultaneously activated the binding of AP - 1 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I O
"Furthermore , PDTC differentially targeted both NFATp and NFATc family members , inhibiting the transactivation functions of NFATp and mRNA induction of NFATc .",O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B O O O O B O
"We propose that the activation of an NFAT kinase by PDTC could be responsible for the rapid shuttling of the NFAT , therefore transiently converting the sustained transactivation of this transcription factor that occurs during lymphocyte activation , and show that c - Jun NH2 - terminal kinase ( JNK ) can act by directly phosphorylating NFATp .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B O O O O O O B O

"In UCSD - AML1 , we have also identified fusion transcripts between the ecotropic viral insertion site I ( EVI1 ) gene in 3q26 and GR6 and between EVI1 and Ribophorin I that maps 30 kb telomeric to GR6 in 3q21 .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I I I I I I O B O B O O B O B I O O O O O O B O B O
"All fusions splice the 5 ' ends of the 3q21 genes into exon 2 of the EVI1 gene , an event that is similar to the normal intergenic splicing of MDS1 - EVI1 and to those previously documented in leukemias with t ( 3 ; 21 ) and t ( 3 ; 12 ) , in which acute myelogenous leukemia 1 - EVI1 fusions and ETV6 - EVI1 fusions , respectively , occur .",O O O O B I I O O B I O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I I I I O O O O B I I I I I O B I I I O O O O O

"The third member of the family , A - myb , shows the most restricted pattern of expression , suggesting a very specific role for this transcription factor .",O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"A - myb is expressed in a subpopulation of normal B lymphocytes activated in vivo and localised in the germinal center of peripheral lymphoid organs and is not detected at significant levels in all other mature or immature haematopoietic populations studied , including bone marrow cells , T lymphocytes , granulocytes , monocytes , either at rest or after in vitro activation .",B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"A - myb is strongly expressed in Burkitt ' s lymphomas ( BL ) and slg + B - acute lymphoblastic leukaemias ( B - ALL ) and not in all other leukaemias / lymphomas tested , with the exception of a subset of CLL ( about 25 % of cases ) .",B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"It is intriguing that the A - myb genome has been localised relatively close to the c - myc gene on chromosome 8 , suggesting that the c - myc translocation in BL and B - ALL may affect A - myb transcription .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Studies are in progress to investigate the functional relationship between A - myb and c - myc , particularly in the context of BL cells and to determine whether A - myb is deregulated in these cells .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
Bcl - 6 protein is a recently identified novel transcription factor whose deregulated expression is associated with diffuse large B cell lymphomas .,B I I I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In the present study , the expression of bcl - 6 protein on normal epidermis , benign , and malignant tumors originating from epidermal cells , and squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) cell lines are investigated .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Sp3 mediates transcriptional activation of the leukocyte integrin genes CD11C and CD11B and cooperates with c - Jun to activate CD11C .,B O O O O O B I I B O B O O O O O O O O B O
The leukocyte integrin genes CD11c and CD11b are expressed predominately in myelomonocytic cells .,O B I I B O B O O O O O O O
"In previous experiments , the - 70 to - 65 and - 121 to - 103 regions of the CD11c promoter and the - 66 to - 59 region of the CD11b promoter were shown to be essential for Sp1 - mediated activation of these genes .",O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O B I O O B I I I I I O O B I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
"In vivo genomic footprinting had also revealed cell - specific binding of protein , presumably Sp1 , to these regions .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"In this study , electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed that the Sp1 - related factor , Sp3 , also binds at or near these same regions .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O
Cotransfection of Sp3 along with CD11c promoter - luciferase constructs into Sp - deficient Drosophila Schneider 2 cells showed that Sp3 could activate the CD11c promoter .,O O B O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I O
Deletion of both the - 70 to - 65 and - 121 to - 103 regions of the CD11c promoter resulted in the loss of activation by Sp3 .,O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O B I O O O O O O O B O
"Both sites showed activation by Sp3 ; however , the - 70 to - 65 region was more responsive to Sp3 than to Sp1 .",O O O O O B O O O O B I I I I I O O O O B O O B O
Similar transfection analysis of the - 66 to - 59 region of the CD11b promoter showed Sp3 - dependent expression .,O O O O O B I I I I I O O B I O B O O O O

Estrogen receptor diminishes DNA - binding activities of chicken GATA - 1 and CACCC - binding proteins .,B I O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O
"In this study , we investigated the effect of ER alpha ( referred to throughout as ER ) on DNA - binding activities of transcription factors involved in regulating the expression of erythroid - specific genes , and , in particular , the histone H5 gene .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I O
"Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we found that in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate , human ER reduced the binding activities of chicken immature erythrocyte nuclear extracted proteins to GATA and CACCC sites in the H5 promoter and enhancer .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I I O O B I I I O
"In contrast , the binding activities of NF1 and Sp1 were not affected by ER .",O O O O O O O B O B O O O O B O
Binding of ER to an estrogen response element was enhanced by addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate .,O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
This lysate was also necessary for ER to diminish the DNA - binding activity of GATA - 1 .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O

Both GATA - 1 and CACCC - binding proteins are critical for the developmentally regulated expression of erythroid - specific genes .,O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O
We hypothesize that interference in DNA - binding activities of GATA - 1 and CACCC - binding proteins is the mechanism by which the ER inhibits regulation of these genes .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Regulation of Id3 cell cycle function by Cdk - 2 - dependent phosphorylation .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The functions of basic helix - loop - helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors in activating differentiation - linked gene expression and in inducing G1 cell cycle arrest are negatively regulated by members of the Id family of HLH proteins .,O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
We now show that an analogous cell - cycle - regulated phosphorylation of Id3 alters the specificity of Id3 for abrogating both E - box - dependent bHLH homo - or heterodimer complex formation in vitro and E - box - dependent reporter gene function in vivo .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
Cdk2 - dependent phosphorylation therefore provides a switch during late G1 - to - S phase that both nullifies an early G1 cell cycle regulatory function of Id3 and modulates its target bHLH specificity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O
These data also demonstrate that the ability of Id3 to promote cell cycle S phase entry is not simply a function of its ability to modulate bHLH heterodimer - dependent gene expression and establish a biologically important mechanism through which Cdk2 and Id - bHLH functions are integrated in the coordination of cell proliferation and differentiation .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

TNFalpha cooperates with the protein kinase A pathway to synergistically increase HIV - 1 LTR transcription via downstream TRE - like cAMP response elements .,B O O O B I I O O O O B I I I O O O B I I I I I O
Activating protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) binding TPA responsive elements ( TRE ) are located downstream of the transcription initiation site in the U5 region of the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .,B I I I O B I I O O B I I O B O O O O O O B I I O O B I O O B I I I I I O B O O
"These downstream sequence elements , termed DSE , can bind both AP - 1 and CREB / ATF transcription factors .",O B I I O O B O O O O B I I O B I I B I O
"Recently , we demonstrated that the DSE are also cAMP - responsive elements ( CRE ) , since they mediated activation signals elicited by cholera toxin ( Ctx ) , a potent activator of the cAMP - dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) signal transduction pathway .",O O O O O O B O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O

Ctx combined with TNFalpha or IL - 1beta to produce a synergistic increase in p24 antigen production in U1 promonocytic cells .,B O O B O B I I O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
"Transfection studies of LTR reporter constructs indicated that mutation of the DSE sites abrogated the LTR - mediated synergy induced by Ctx and TNFalpha , whereas the synergy induced by Ctx and IL - 1beta was unaffected , suggesting TNFalpha and IL - 1beta cooperate differently with the cAMP / PKA activation pathway to induce HIV - 1 expression in U1 cells .",O O O B I I O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O B O B I I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Because the DSE are also TRE sites , we assessed the effect of the agonist combinations on AP - 1 - dependent transcription .",O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
TNFalpha as well as IL - 1beta cooperated with Ctx to produce a synergistic activation of AP - 1 - mediated transcription .,B O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O

Association of glucocorticoid insensitivity with increased expression of glucocorticoid receptor beta .,O O O O O O O O B I I O
"The molecular basis of GC insensitivity , however , is unknown .",O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Alternative splicing of the GC receptor ( R ) pre - messenger RNA generates a second GCR , termed GCR - beta , which does not bind GCs but antagonizes the transactivating activity of the classic GCR , termed GCR - alpha .",O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O
"In the current study , we demonstrate that GC - insensitive asthma is associated with a significantly higher number of GCR - beta - immunoreactive cells in peripheral blood than GC - sensitive asthmatics or normal controls .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These abnormalities can be reproduced by transfection of cell lines with the GCR - beta gene resulting in significant reduction of their GCR - alpha DNA binding capacity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
We conclude that increased expression of GCR - beta is cytokine inducible and may account for GC insensitivity in this common inflammatory condition .,O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O

EBNA3C is a potent repressor of transcription when bound to DNA as a fusion with the DNA binding domain ( DBD ) of GALA .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O
"A survey of promoters has revealed that the wild - type , unfused EBNA3C can specifically repress expression from reporter plasmids containing the Epstein - Barr virus Cp latency - associated promoter .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I I O
"Repression of Cp activity required amino acids 207 to 368 , which encompasses a region resembling a basic DBD adjacent to a leucine zipper DNA binding motif and a site which binds to the cellular factor CBF1 / RBP - Jkappa .",O O B O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"However , amino acids 207 to 368 are dispensable when the protein is bound to DNA as a fusion with the GAL4 DBD , thus implicating this region in DNA binding .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"Consistent with this result , mutation of the EBNA2 response element ( a CBF1 / RBP - Jkappa binding site ) in Cp also prevented significant repression .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I O O B O O O O O
"In addition , amino acids 346 to 543 , which were previously defined as important for the repressor activity of the GAL4 - EBNA3C fusion proteins , also appear to be necessary for the repression of Cp .",O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Since repression by these fusions was not observed in all cell types , it seems likely that EBNA3C either depends on a corepressor which may interact with amino acids 346 to 543 or is modified in a cell - specific manner in order to repress .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Considering that nuclear regulatory factor - kappa beta ( NF - kappa B ) / Rel is a common regulatory element of the promoter region of the inflammatory cytokine genes , herein , we tested the hypothesis that acute ethanol affects NF - kappa B activation in human monocytes .",O O B I I I I I B I I I I I I I O O O B I O O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
Adherence - isolated monocytes showed constitutive DNA binding activity of NF - kappa B .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"A clinically relevant dose ( 25 mM ) of acute ethanol treatment in vitro increased NF - kappa B binding activity in monocytes with a preferential induction of the inhibitory , p50 / p50 , NF - kappa B / Rel homodimer , and resulted in no induction of the p65 / p50 heterodimer .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O

LPS tolerance in monocytes / macrophages : three 3 ' cytosins are required in the DNA binding motif for detection of upregulated NF - kappa B p50 homodimers .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I I I I O

Tolerant cells still express the CD14 receptor and they can still be activated to mobilize NF - kappa B into nucleus .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O
Analysis of the binding proteins employing the - 605 motif of the human TNF promoter ( GGGGCTGTCCC ) revealed that in tolerant cells of the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 there is a predominance of p50p50 of NF - kappa B .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I O
We now show that a mutant motif that exchanges the terminal 3 ' C for a G fails to bind the p50 homodimer that is upregulated in LPS toler ant human Mono Mac 6 cells .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"We also considered associations of these variables with plasma renin activity , aldosterone , cortisol , corticotropin , and electrolyte concentrations .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
We calculated binding affinity ( Kd ; nmol / L ) and capacity ( Bmax ; sites / cell ) for dexamethasone and cortisol from homologous and heterologous competition curves for specific [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding sites on HML isolated from the blood of normotensive volunteers and subjects with essential hypertension .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Glucocorticoid responsiveness of HML was evaluated as IC50 values ( nmol / L ) for dexamethasone and cortisol for the inhibition of lysozyme release .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
We measured plasma hormones by radioimmunoassay .,O O O O O O O
"Kd values ( mean + / - SE ) for cortisol in HML of hypertensive patients were higher than in control subjects ( 24 . 6 + / - 2 . 4 versus 17 . 5 + / - 1 . 7 nmol / L , P < . 04 ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both Kd ( 30 . 3 + / - 2 . 5 versus 19 . 2 + / - 2 . 4 nmol / L ) and IC50 values ( 15 . 5 + / - 1 . 8 versus 8 . 9 + / - 1 . 2 nmol / L ) for cortisol were significantly higher in patients with lower renin values ( P < . 03 ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"Other variables , including plasma hormone and electrolyte values and binding characteristics for dexamethasone , were not different .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data suggest that cortisol binding to glucocorticoid receptor is slightly impaired in patients with essential hypertension .,O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
"In vivo , this could lead to inappropriate binding of cortisol to mineralocorticoid receptors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Hence , decreased sensitivity to cortisol is associated with renin suppression .",O O O O O O O O O B O O
"This hypothesis is supported by evidence of hypertension and low renin activity , which others have described in patients with primary glucocorticoid resistance due to mutations of the glucocorticoid receptor .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
PU . 1 / Pip and basic helix loop helix zipper transcription factors interact with binding sites in the CD20 promoter to help confer lineage - and stage - specific expression of CD20 in B lymphocytes .,B I I I I O B I I I I I I O O B I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
CD20 is a B - lineage - specific gene expressed at the pre - B - cell stage of B - cell development that disappears on differentiation to plasma cells .,B O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"As such , it serves as an excellent paradigm for the study of lineage and developmental stage - specific gene expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using in vivo footprinting we identified two sites in the promoter at - 45 and - 160 that were occupied only in CD20 + B cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B O O O O
The - 45 site is an E box that binds basic helix - loop - helix - zipper proteins whereas the - 160 site is a composite PU . 1 and Pip binding site .,O B I I O O B I O O B I I I I I I I I O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I O
Transfection studies with reporter constructs and various expression vectors verified the importance of these sites .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
Glucocorticoids and the immune function in the human immunodeficiency virus infection : a study in hypercortisolemic and cortisol - resistant patients .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Immunological studies in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - positive patients suggest that the disease progression is accompanied by a defective production of type 1 cytokines ( interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) and IL - 12 ] , an increased production of type 2 cytokines ( IL - 4 , IL - 6 , and IL - 10 ) , and an increased production of IgE .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O B O
"As cortisol is involved in the physiological regulation of cytokines , a study was conducted to examine cytokine patterns in two groups of hypercortisolemic patients , one with normal sensitivity to glucocorticoids and the other with glucocorticoid resistance .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Ten HIV - infected patients with normal receptor affinity to glucocorticoids ( AIDS - C ) , 10 HIV - infected patients with low receptor affinity to glucocorticoids ( AIDS - GR ) , and 20 healthy subjects were studied .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Receptor characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated by [ 3H ] dexamethasone binding .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serum cortisol and urinary free cortisol were measured by RIA .,O O O O O O O O O O O
"Serum ACTH and IgE were measured by immunoradiometric assay , and IL - 2 , IL - 4 , and IL - 10 cytokines and interferon - gamma were measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay .",O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I B O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"AIDS - C patients showed low IL - 2 and high IL - 4 , IL - 10 , and IgE concentratios ; conversely , AIDS - GR patients showed high IL - 2 and low IL - 4 and IgE concentrations .",O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O B O O
"Thus , in HIV infection , elevated cortisol levels suppress cell - mediated immunity and stimulate humoral immunity , whereas this response is not detected in cortisol - resistant patients .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings indicate that cortisol and its receptors are critically involved in the regulation of immune function in HIV infection .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Monocytic differentiation of HL - 60 promyelocytic leukemia cells correlates with the induction of Bcl - xL .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Treatment of human promyelocytic leukemia HL - 60 cells with phorbol esters ultimately induces the differentiation of these cells along the monocyte / macrophage lineage , whereas treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO induces granulocytic / neutrophillic differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we demonstrate the disparate fates of HL - 60 cells treated with the phorbol ester 12 , 13 - phorbol dibutyric acid ( PDBu ) or DMSO .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The levels of the apoptosis effector proteins Bak and Bad were enhanced , whereas there was a slight down - regulation of the apoptosis suppressor protein Bcl - 2 after treatment of the cells with PDBu and DMSO .",O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Treatment with DMSO resulted in the elevation of the apoptosis effector Bax , whereas treatment with PDBu did not significantly alter the levels of this protein .",O O O O O O O O O B I B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , treatment of HL - 60 cells with PDBu induced the rapid expression of the apoptosis suppressor protein Bcl - xL , whereas the expression of this protein remained unaltered in DMSO - treated cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"PDBu - treated HL - 60 cells remained viable for 7 days and thereafter began to die via apoptosis , with a concomitant down - regulation of Bcl - xL .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"In conclusion , we propose that Bcl - xL expression is associated with differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells along the monocyte / macrophage lineage .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Monochloramine inhibits phorbol ester - inducible neutrophil respiratory burst activation and T cell interleukin - 2 receptor expression by inhibiting inducible protein kinase C activity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O
The effects of chemically prepared monochloramine ( NH2Cl ) on protein kinase C ( PKC ) and PKC - mediated cellular responses were studied in elicited rat peritoneal neutrophils and human Jurkat T cells .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Neutrophils pretreated with NH2Cl ( 30 - 50 microM ) showed a marked decrease in the respiratory burst activity induced by phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , which is a potent PKC activator .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
"These cells , however , were viable and showed a complete respiratory burst upon arachidonic acid stimulation , which induces the respiratory burst by a PKC - independent mechanism .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
"The NH2Cl - treated neutrophils showed a decrease in both PKC activity and PMA - induced phosphorylation of a 47 - kDa protein , which corresponds to the cytosolic factor of NADPH oxidase , p47 ( phox ) .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I O B I O B I I I O
Jurkat T cells pretreated with NH2Cl ( 20 - 70 microM ) showed a decrease in the expression of the interleukin - 2 receptor alpha chain following PMA stimulation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I I O O O O
"This was also accompanied by a decrease in both PKC activity and nuclear transcription factor - kappaB activation , also without loss of cell viability .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
These results show that NH2Cl inhibits PKC - mediated cellular responses through inhibition of the inducible PKC activity .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O
Evidence that calcineurin is rate - limiting for primary human lymphocyte activation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In vitro , CsA inhibits lymphocyte gene activation by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of calcineurin ( CN ) .",O O O O O B I O O O O B O O B O B O O
"In clinical use , CsA treatment inhibits 50 - 75 % of CN activity in circulating leukocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
We modeled this degree of CN inhibition in primary human leukocytes in vitro in order to study the effect of partial CN inhibition on the downstream signaling events that lead to gene activation .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In CsA - treated leukocytes stimulated by calcium ionophore , the degree of reduction in CN activity was accompanied by a similar degree of inhibition of each event tested : dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T cell proteins , nuclear DNA binding , activation of a transfected reporter gene construct , IFN - gamma and IL - 2 mRNA accumulation , and IFN - gamma production .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O

Selection of down - regulated sequences along the monocytic differentiation of leukemic HL60 cells .,O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
In order to dissect the molecular mechanisms of monocytic differentiation we have developed a subtractive hybridisation method based on a simplified ' representational difference analysis ' .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have selected 16 sequences and confirmed their down - regulation along the TPA - induced monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Among these sequences we have identified the alpha - tubulin , the TaxREB protein and two ribosomal protein sequences which had not been previously described as differentially expressed .",O O O O O O O B I I O O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
These results add to our knowledge about the molecules implicated along the monocytic differentiation and growth arrest of leukemic cells and provide a first step in the study of their respective roles .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In mammalian cells , I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta proteins have been purified and shown to be the inhibitors of NF - kappa B through their association with the p65 or c - Rel subunits .",O O O O B I I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I I I O
"In addition , we have isolated a third NF - kappa B inhibitor , I kappa B epsilon ( 1 ) .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I I O O O O
"Upon treatment with a large variety of inducers , I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta are proteolytically degraded , resulting in NF - kappa B translocation into the nucleus .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
Here we show that in E29 . 1 T cell hybridoma I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta are equally associated with p65 and that I kappa B beta is degraded in response to TNF alpha in contrast to what has been originally published .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O B O O B I I I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
"Our data also suggest that , unlike I kappa B alpha , I kappa B beta is constitutively phosphorylated and resynthesized as a hypophosphorylated form .",O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O B I O
The absence of slow migrating forms of I kappa B beta following stimulation suggests that the phosphorylation does not necessarily constitute the signal - induced event which targets the molecule for proteolysis .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Agonistic activity of a CD40 - specific single - chain Fv constructed from the variable regions of mAb G28 - 5 .,O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I O B I I I O
A single - chain Fv ( sFv ) was expressed from the variable regions of the CD40 - specific mAb G28 - 5 .,O B I I I O B O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I I O
The molecule bound CD40 with a high affinity ( 2 . 2 nM ) and was a monomer in solution .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Surprisingly , G28 - 5 sFv was a potent CD40 agonist that rapidly crosslinked CD40 on the cell surface but did not crosslink CD40 - Ig in solution .",O O B I I I O O O B I O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
"G28 - 5 IgG partially blocked , whereas G28 - 5 sFv augmented CD40 responses during stimulation with natural ligand ( gp39 - CD8 fusion protein ) .",B I I I O O O O B I I I O B O O O O B I O B I I I I O O
These results indicate that the functional activity of ligands built from the binding site of G28 - 5 is highly dependent upon the size and physical properties of the molecule both in solution and on the cell surfaces .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
C / EBP activates the human corticotropin - releasing hormone gene promoter .,B I I O O B I I I I I I O
"The purpose of these studies was to identify whether transcription factors , associated with cytokine signalling , affected promoter activity of the corticotropin releasing hormone ( CRH ) gene .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
Fragments of a 3 . 6 kb sequence of the human CRH gene promoter were amplified by PCR and ligated upstream of a CAT reporter .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O
"These constructs were transfected into a variety of cell lines , either alone or together , with transcription factor expression vectors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
Basal activity of a 3070 bp CRH promoter fragment was only seen in neuronal and lymphoblastoid cell lines .,O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Promoter activity was increased by the transcription factors C / EBPbeta ( NF - IL6 ) and more strongly , by C / EBPdelta ( NF - IL6beta ) .",O O O O O O B I B I I O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O
"Moreover , the inverse changes in the expression of CRH in the hypothalamus and spleens of arthritic rats were paralleled by similar inverse changes in NF - IL6beta expression in these organs .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
These data show that some transcription factors associated with cytokine signalling can also activate the CRH promoter .,O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O B I O
Aberrant splicing of the TSG101 and FHIT genes occurs frequently in multiple malignancies and in normal tissues and mimics alterations previously described in tumours .,O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Intragenic deletions of TSG101 , the human homolog of a mouse gene ( tsg101 ) that acts to suppress malignant cell growth , were reported in human breast tumours .",O O O B O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analysis of DNA failed to show genomic rearrangements corresponding to transcripts containing deletions in the same samples .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The breakpoints of most transcript deletions coincide with genuine or cryptic splice site sequences , suggesting that they result from alternative or aberrant splicing .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
We analysed FHIT in the same series of RNA samples and detected truncated FHIT transcripts frequently in both tumour and normal tissues .,O O B O O O O O B I O O O B I O O O O O O O O
"In addition , transcripts from TSG101 , FHIT and seven other genes were analysed in RNA isolated from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes .",O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Large TSG101 and FHIT intragenic transcript deletions were detected and these appeared to be the predominant transcript in ' aged ' lymphocytes .,O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similar alterations were not detected in transcripts of the other genes which were analysed .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our findings demonstrate that truncated TSG101 and FHIT transcripts are commonly detected in both normal and malignant tissues and that a significant fraction of these are likely to be the result of aberrant splicing .,O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"While we can not exclude that alterations in TSG101 and FHIT occur during cancer development , our data indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript abnormalities are misleading .",O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis of human and rat T lymphocytes by curcumin , a curry pigment .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Curcumin ( diferuoylmethane ) , the yellow pigment in the rhizome of tumeric ( Curcuma longa ) , an ingredient of curry spice , is known to exhibit a variety of pharmacological effects including antitumor , antiinflammatory , and antiinfectious activities .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Although its precise mode of action remains elusive , curcumin has been shown to suppress the activity of the AP - 1 transcription factor in cells stimulated to proliferate .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I O O O O O O
"In this study , we observed that curcumin ( 50 microM ) inhibited proliferation of rat thymocytes stimulated with concanavalin A ( Con A ) as well as that of human Jurkat lymphoblastoid cells in the logarithmic growth phase .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The pigment also inhibited apoptosis in dexamethasone - treated rat thymocytes and in UV - irradiated Jurkat cells as judged by DNA ladder formation , cellular morphological changes , and flow cytometry analysis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The inhibition of apoptosis by curcumin in rat thymocytes was accompanied by partial suppression of AP - 1 activity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Complete suppression of AP - 1 activity was observed in Con A - treated , proliferating thymocytes .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The capacity of curcumin to inhibit both cell growth and death strongly implies that these two biological processes share a common pathway at some point and that curcumin affects a common step , presumably involving a modulation of the AP - 1 transcription factor .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I O

"T - cell receptor ( TCR ) / CD3 engagement results in the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) , and nuclear factor kappaB ( NFkappaB ) , whereas the CD28 responsive complex ( CD28RC ) is activated in response to the CD28 signal .",B I I I B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I O B I I O O O B I I O B O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O B O O
Costimulation of phytohemagglutinin / anti - CD28 activated T lymphocytes with IL - 7 induces a fivefold enhanced IL - 2 - mRNA accumulation and a 2 . 5 - fold enhanced protein secretion .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The IL - 2 - gene transcription rate is increased 3 . 4 - fold , indicating that the effect of IL - 7 is in part mediated at the transcriptional level .",O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"The molecular mechanisms underlying the IL - 7 effect involve the upregulation of the DNA binding activity of NFAT ( 60 % ) and AP - 1 ( 120 % ) , without affecting the activities of NFkappaB and CD28RC , which was confirmed by transfection assays .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
We also show that the IL - 7 - induced enhancement of the AP - 1 - DNA binding activity is not cyclosporin A - sensitive .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Since AP - 1 is part of the NFAT complex , we conclude that the IL - 7 - signaling pathway is involved in the activation of the fos and jun proteins of which AP - 1 consists .",O B I I O O O O B I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I O O
The spatial distribution of human immunoglobulin genes within the nucleus : evidence for gene topography independent of cell type and transcriptional activity .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Although the activating signals leading to Egr - 1 induction have been studied extensively , little is known about the genes that are placed further downstream within this activation cascade and that are transcriptionally regulated by Egr - 1 .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"To identify such target genes , we established Egr - 1 - overexpressing transfectants from the murine B cell line K46 and from human Ramos B cells .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All clones derived from K46 B cells showed increased expression of CD44 .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Most interestingly , expression of CD95 ( Fas / Apo - 1 ) and of CD23 was down - regulated in all K46 transfectants .",O O O O O B O B I I I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"As a consequence , they became resistant to apoptosis induced by anti - CD95 Ab treatment .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
"Similarly , the Egr - 1 - expressing Ramos cells showed reduced levels of CD95 expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
"Thus , Egr - 1 seems to control the expression of downstream target genes not only as a transcriptional activator , but also as a repressor molecule .",O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"In B cells , Egr - 1 therefore plays a critical role in integrating the short - lived signal delivered by triggering of the Ag receptor into phenotypic changes , including repression of CD95 and CD23 transcription .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B O B O O
Regulation of NF - kappa B activity by I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta stability .,O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Little is known about the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of constitutive nuclear NF - kappa B in some cell - types and of sustained nuclear NF - kappa B activity after stimulation .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
Increased turnover has been implicated in the regulation of constitutive NF - kappa B activity in mature B cells .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O
We therefore compared the turnover of I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta in mature B cells and HeLa cells .,O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O
Both proteins display a high turnover in B cells although I kappa B beta is considerably more stable than I kappa B alpha .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I O
"In contrast , all other NF - kappa B / I kappa B molecules tested are relatively stable in both cell - types .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The elevated turnover of endogenous I kappa B alpha in Namalwa cells is inhibited by a proteasome inhibitor and thus seems to be driven by the same degradation machinery as the slower turnover in non - B cells .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , we investigated the processes involved in persistent activation of NF - kappa B .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
TNF - alpha signaling leads to a rapid depletion of cellular I kappa B beta pools .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
I kappa B alpha is efficiently resynthesized whereas I kappa B beta levels stay low for a prolonged time .,B I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
NF - kappa B binding activity can be detected for several hours after stimulation .,B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
We found that removal of the TNF - alpha containing medium causes a rapid decrease in nuclear NF - kappa B .,O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I I O
A phosphoform of newly synthesized I kappa B alpha is visible when degradation by the proteasome is inhibited and new I kappa B alpha displays the same properties regarding phosphorylation and degradation in response to a second inducer .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is no significant difference in the turnover of pre - and post - inductive I kappa B alpha .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
These observations suggest that resynthesis of I kappa B alpha and removal of the stimulus are obligatory steps for the inactivation of nuclear NF kappa B .,O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Selection of a diverse TCR repertoire in response to an Epstein - Barr virus - encoded transactivator protein BZLF1 by CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes during primary and persistent infection .,O O O O B I O O O O B I I I I I I I B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We investigated the CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) repertoire to an HLA B8 - restricted peptide , RAKFKQLLQ , located in the Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) immediate - early protein , BZLF1 .",O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O B O
Repertoire selection was monitored by determining the TCR beta chain sequences of RAKFKQLLQ - specific CTL established from primary infected and healthy virus carriers .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Polyclonal and clonal CTL that were generated by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an HLA B8 + homozygous LCL lysed T cell blasts pulsed with the peptide , RAKFKQLLQ ; lysis of certain HLA B8 + LCL targets was associated with the abundance of BZLF1 transcripts .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
TCR - contact site heterogeneity was excluded as the selective force in diversity generation since the epitope - encoded sequences were found to be identical within endogenous virus isolates .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this first study of TCR repertoire selection for an EBV lytic antigen , a BZLF1 - reactive component of diverse clonotypes was identified in primary type A or type B EBV infection which was sustained in the EBV - specific memory response throughout life - long infection .",O O O O O B I O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Molecular mechanisms of anoxia / reoxygenation - induced neutrophil adherence to cultured endothelial cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The objectives of this study were to ( 1 ) determine the time course of neutrophil adhesion to monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) that were exposed to 60 minutes of anoxia followed by 30 to 600 minutes of reoxygenation and ( 2 ) define the mechanisms responsible for both the early ( minutes ) and late ( hours ) hyperadhesivity of postanoxic HUVECs to human neutrophils .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The results clearly demonstrate that anoxia / reoxygenation ( A / R ) leads to a biphasic increase in neutrophil adhesion to HUVECs , with peak responses occurring at 30 minutes ( phase 1 ) and 240 minutes ( phase 2 ) after reoxygenation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Oxypurinol and catalase inhibited phase - 1 adhesion , suggesting a role for xanthine oxidase and H2O2 .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
"In comparison , platelet activating factor ( PAF ) contributed to both phases of neutrophil adhesion .",O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O
"Anti - intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) and anti - P - selectin antibodies ( monoclonal antibodies [ mAbs ] ) attenuated phase - 1 neutrophil adhesion , consistent with roles for constitutively expressed ICAM - 1 and enhanced surface expression of preformed P - selectin .",B I I I I I I O B I I O O B I I I I I O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O
"Phase - 2 neutrophil adhesion was attenuated by an anti - E - selectin mAb , indicating a dominant role of this adhesion molecule in the late phase response .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide or with competing ds - oligonucleotides containing the nuclear factor - kappa B or activator protein - 1 cognate DNA sequences significantly attenuated phase - 2 response , suggesting a role for de novo macromolecule synthesis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I I B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Surface expression of ICAM - 1 , P - selectin , and E - selectin on HUVECs correlated with the phase - 1 and - 2 neutrophil adhesion responses .",O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Collectively , these findings indicate that A / R elicits a two - phase neutrophil - endothelial cell adhesion response that involves transcription - independent and transcription - dependent surface expression of different endothelial cell adhesion molecules .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Characterization of CD40 signaling determinants regulating nuclear factor - kappa B activation in B lymphocytes .,O O B O O O B I I I I O O O O O
CD40 signaling to B cells is important for generating an effective humoral immune response .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analysis of CD40 cytoplasmic domain truncation and point mutants defined a 10 - amino acid CD40 cytoplasmic signaling determinant required for NF - kappa B activation .,O O B I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O B I I I O O
"This suggests that in B cells , CD40 - induced NF - kappa B activation can occur independently of TRAF2 and TRAF5 association .",O O O O O O O B O O B I I I O O O O O B O B O O
Proteasome - dependent inhibitory kappa B alpha ( I kappa B alpha ) and I kappa B beta degradation occurred downstream of CD40 ligation and preceded CD40 - mediated NF - kappa B nuclear translocation .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O O O O B O O O B O O B I I I O O O

CD30 - dependent degradation of TRAF2 : implications for negative regulation of TRAF signaling and the control of cell survival .,B O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
CD30 is a cell - surface receptor that can augment lymphocyte activation and survival through its ability to induce the transcription factor NF - kappaB .,B O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I O
"CD30 , however , has also been implicated in the induction of apoptotic cell death of lymphocytes .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we show that one of the effects of CD30 signal transduction is to render cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the type 1 tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR1 ) .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O
This sensitization is dependent on the TRAF - binding sites within the CD30 cytoplasmic domain .,O O O O O O B I I I O O B B I O
"One of the proteins that binds to these sites is TRAF2 , a signal transduction molecule that is also utilized by TNFR1 to mediate the activation of several downstream kinases and transcription factors .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O B I O
"During CD30 signal transduction , we found that binding of TRAF2 to the cytoplasmic domain of CD30 results in the rapid depletion of TRAF2 and the associated protein TRAF1 by proteolysis .",O B O O O O O O O O B O O B I O B O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O
These data suggest a model in which CD30 limits its own ability to transduce cell survival signals through signal - coupled depletion of TRAF2 .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Depletion of intracellular TRAF2 and its coassociated proteins also increased the sensitivity of the cell to undergoing apoptosis during activation of death - inducing receptors such as TNFR1 .,O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B O
"Consistent with this hypothesis , expression of a dominant - negative form of TRAF2 was found to potentiate TNFR1 - mediated death .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O B O O O O
"These studies provide a potential mechanism through which CD30 , as well as other TRAF - binding members of the TNFR superfamily , can negatively regulate cell survival .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I O O B I O O O O O O O

"The highly specific granulomonocyte - associated lysosomal proteins myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) and lysozyme ( LZ ) , as well as the transcription factor PU . 1 , were already detectable in the most immature CD34 + Thy - 1 + subset .",O O O B I I I I B O B O O B O B O O O O O O B I B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Messenger RNA ( mRNA ) levels for the granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) receptor , granulocyte - macrophage ( GM ) - CSF receptor alpha subunit and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) receptors I ( p55 ) and II ( p75 ) were also detected in this subset in addition to c - kit and flt - 3 , receptors known to be expressed on progenitor cells .",B I O B O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O B I I I I I I I I I I O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"By contrast , the monocyte - macrophage colony stimulating factor ( M - CSF ) receptor was largely absent at this stage and in the CD34 + Thy - 1 - CD45RA - subsets .",O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Different cocktails of the identified ligands were added to sorted CD34 + Thy - 1 + single cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"In addition , we show that TNF - alpha is a potent costimulatory factor of the very immature CD34 + Thy - 1 + CB subset .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Recent studies from our laboratory have indicated that protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTPase ) inhibitors can down - modulate the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - mediated activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF - kappa B in ML - 1a , a monocytic cell line ( Singh and Aggarwal , J .

"Since TNF is one of the major inducers of various adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells and their expression is known to require the activation of NF - kappa B , we examined the effect of PTPase inhibitors on the TNF - mediated induction of intracellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) - 1 , vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) - 1 and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule ( ELAM ) - 1 .",O B O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O B I I I I I I I O B I I I I I I I I O B I I I I I I I I O
"Like ML - 1a , human dermal microvessel endothelial cells ( MVEC ) treated with TNF rapidly activated ( within 30 min ) NF - kappa B ; this effect was completely abolished by co - treatment with phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , a specific inhibitor of PTPase .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O

Is celiac disease due to molecular mimicry between gliadin peptide - HLA class II molecule - T cell interactions and those of some unidentified superantigen ?,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I O
This paper presents a new hypothesis for the etiology and pathogenesis of celiac disease ( CD ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Although hypoxia alone did not induce ICAM - 1 , the combination of LPS and hypoxia enhanced ( 3 + / - 0 . 4 - fold over normoxia ) ICAM - 1 expression .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Combinations of hypoxia and LPS significantly increased lymphocyte binding , and such increases were inhibited by addition of anti - ICAM - 1 antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O
"Hypoxic endothelia showed a > 10 - fold increase in sensitivity to inhibitors of proteasome activation , and combinations of hypoxia and LPS enhanced proteasome - dependent cytoplasmic - to - nuclear localization of the nuclear transcription factor - kappa B p65 ( Rel A ) subunit .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O

"Differanisole A and 9 - cis retinoic acid ( 9cisRA ) synergistically inhibited the growth and induced functional and morphologic differentiation of HL - 60 and NB4 cells , whereas the combined treatment with differanisole A and all - trans retinoic acid or 1alpha , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 was less effective .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similar results were obtained in primary culture of leukemia cells from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The synergistic effect on growth inhibition and induction of differentiation required simultaneous treatment with differanisole A and 9cisRA .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Suppression of nuclear factor kappa B and CD18 - mediated leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium by dexamethasone .,O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS : Cultured bovine corneal endothelium was stimulated for 6 hours by 40 micron / ml tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O

CONCLUSIONS : Leukocyte adhesion to the corneal endothelium was shown to be mediated by CD18 expressed on activated leukocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Pretreatment of the endothelium with dexamethasone inhibited leukocyte adhesion ; this may be due in part to the suppression of NFkappaB entry into the nucleus .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
Molecular characterization and pattern of tissue expression of the gene for neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin from humans .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O
Neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) is a 25 - kDa lipocalin first identified as a protein stored in specific granules of the human neutrophil .,B I I I I O B O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The protein is believed to bind small lipophilic substances such as bacterial derived formylpeptides and lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) and might function as a modulator of inflammation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To characterize the regulation of NGAL further , we have cloned and sequenced a 5869 - bp region of the NGAL gene including 1695 bp of the 5 ' nontranscribed region and a 3696 - bp coding region encompassing seven exons and six introns .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I O B I I I I O

The ability of BHRF1 to inhibit apoptosis is dependent on stimulus and cell type .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The development of resistance to host defense mechanisms such as tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - and Fas - mediated apoptosis of transformed or virus - infected cells may be a critical component in the development of disease .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To find genes that protect cells from apoptosis , we used an expression cloning strategy and identified BHRF1 , an Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) early - lytic - cycle protein with distant homology to Bcl - 2 , as an anti - apoptosis protein .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O B I I O O O B I I I O
Expression of BHRF1 in MCF - Fas cells conferred nearly complete resistance against both anti - Fas antibody and TNF - mediated apoptosis .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O

"Moreover , the mechanism of action of BHRF1 resembled that of Bcl - 2 and Bcl - xL as it inhibited TNF - and anti - Fas - induced activation of two enzymes participating in the apoptosis pathway , cytosolic phospholipase A2 and caspase - 3 / CPP32 , but did not interfere with the activation of NF - kappaB - like transcription factors .",O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
A putative function of BHRF1 in EBV - infected epithelial cells may be to protect virus - infected cells from TNF - and / or anti - Fas - induced cell death in order to maximize virus production .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Surprisingly , expression of neither BHRF1 nor Bcl - 2 in a B - cell line , BJAB , protected the cells from anti - Fas - mediated apoptosis even though they increased the survival of serum - starved cells .",O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thus , the protective role of BHRF1 against apoptosis resembles that of Bcl - 2 in being cell type specific and dependent on the apoptotic stimulus .",O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

"However , the cellular or molecular factors responsible for a delay in B - CLL cell death are unknown .",O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We have investigated the mechanism of transactivation mediated by the CIITA activation domain by studying its role in the process of transcription initiation and elongation .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Specifically the altered specificity TBP ( TATA box binding protein ) assay has been used to analyze the response of the CIITA activation domain to mutations in TBP known to disrupt its interaction with its associated general factors .,O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O
Transactivation by CIITA was extremely sensitive to a mutation in TBP that in yeast is known to abolish VP16 - mediated transcription but leaves basal transcription unaffected .,O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
A TBP mutant defective in interaction with TBP - associated factor TAFII250 also failed to mediate transactivation through the CIITA activation domain .,O O O O O O O B I I I B O O O O O O O B I I O
Certain interactions between TBP and general factors that are specifically required for acidic activation domains were also required for CIITA - mediated transactivation to reach its full potential .,O O O B O B I O O O O O B I I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"Finally , like VP16 , CIITA was able to stimulate elongation of transcription .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Overall the mechanism of transactivation by the human B - cell - specific CIITA is very similar to that mediated by the herpes virus transactivator VP16 in the ways that have been tested .,O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I B O O O O O O O O
Relief of cyclin A gene transcriptional inhibition during activation of human primary T lymphocytes via CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules .,O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B O B B I O
Cyclin A transcription is cell cycle regulated and induced by cell proliferative signals .,B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stimulation of purified T lymphocytes by a combination of monoclonal antibodies directed at CD2 and CD28 adhesion molecules gives rise to a long lasting proliferation in the absence of accessory cells .,O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O B B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cyclin A was observed after 4 days of costimulation with anti CD2 + CD28 whereas stimulation by anti CD2 or anti CD28 alone was not effective .,B I O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O B I O B I O O O O O
"In vivo genomic DMS footprinting revealed upstream of the major transcription initiation sites , the presence of at least three protein binding sites , two of which were constitutively occupied .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O

The mitogenic combination of anti CD2 + anti CD28 released the footprint as cells were committed to proliferation .,O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O
"Consistent with theses results , nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent cells formed a specific complex with this element , whereas extracts prepared from cells treated with anti CD2 + anti CD28 failed to do so after cells entered a proliferative state .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
An enhancer - blocking element between alpha and delta gene segments within the human T cell receptor alpha / delta locus .,O B I I I O B I I I I O O B I I I I I I I O
T cell receptor ( TCR ) alpha and delta gene segments are organized within a single genetic locus but are differentially regulated during T cell development .,B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"An enhancer - blocking element ( BEAD - 1 , for blocking element alpha / delta 1 ) was localized to a 2 . 0 - kb region 3 ' of TCR delta gene segments and 5 ' of TCR alpha joining gene segments within this locus .",O B I I I O B I I O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I I I I I O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I I O O O O
BEAD - 1 blocked the ability of the TCR delta enhancer ( Edelta ) to activate a promoter when located between the two in a chromatin - integrated construct .,B I I O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"We propose that BEAD - 1 functions as a boundary that separates the TCR alpha / delta locus into distinct regulatory domains controlled by Edelta and the TCR alpha enhancer , and that it prevents Edelta from opening the chromatin of the TCR alpha joining gene segments for VDJ recombination at an early stage of T cell development .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I O O B O O B I I O O O O O B O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uncoupling of cell cycle arrest from the expression of monocytic differentiation markers in HL60 cell variants .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Differentiation generally leads to cell cycle arrest .,O O O O O O O O
"Human leukemia HL60 cells respond to the presence of 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 , 25D3 ) by expressing a number of markers of the monocyte / macrophage phenotype and become arrested predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We now describe another series ( B ) of such variants , which differ from A series cells grown in similar concentrations of 1 , 25D3 in that they express the CD14 antigen and nonspecific esterase , characteristic of the monocyte , while continuing to proliferate and they develop hypotetraploid DNA ( 4C ) content at higher concentrations of ambient 1 , 25D3 than the A series cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cells in the B series with 4C DNA content ( 100B and 200B ) also differed from the A series 4C cells by the absence of DNA binding by the full - length Sp1 transcription factor .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B B I O
"However , B series cells resembled the A series cells in exhibiting faster growth rates than the parental HL60 cells and showed high levels of vitamin D receptor and retinoid receptor X proteins .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O
"These results show that the initial steps in the 1 , 25D3 signaling pathway are intact in B series resistant cells and lead to the appearance of early markers of monocytic differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , the progression to subsequent events which comprise terminal differentiation and cell cycle arrest is halted during the adaptation to the presence of 1 , 25D3 in these cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thus , the availability of these variant cells should provide a system for studying the link between differentiation and cell cycle arrest .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in vitro by a novel combination of anti - Tat single - chain intrabodies and NF - kappa B antagonists .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O
"Tat also superactivates the HIV - 1 promoter through a TAR - independent mechanism , including tumor necrosis factor alpha - induced and protein kinase C ( PKC ) - dependent activation of NF - kappa B , and inhibitors of Tat and NF - kappa B cooperatively down - regulate this Tat - mediated LTR superactivation .",O O O O B I I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I O O O O B O B I I I O O O O O B O O B O O

Transcription factors in immune - mediated disease .,B I O O O O O O
A large amount of detailed information about the intracellular proteins regulating NF - kappa B activation and the cellular response to NF - kappa B activation has emerged recently .,O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
"Several small molecules , an antisense oligonucleotide , and gene therapeutic agents that inhibit NF - kappa b activation have been described .",O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O

"Involvement of Rel , Fos , and Jun proteins in binding activity to the IL - 2 promoter CD28 response element / AP - 1 sequence in human T cells .",O O B I I I I I I O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O
"Costimulation of T cells through both the Ag receptor and CD28 leads to high level IL - 2 production , which is vital to the development of an immune response in vivo .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Previous reports have suggested the CD28 stimulation contributes to the activation of the IL - 2 promoter by up - regulating the activity of several transcription factors , including AP - 1 and nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - kappaB ) / Rel family members as well as an uncharacterized transcription factor called CD28 response complex .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O B I I O B O O O
"While several lines of investigation have suggested that NF - kappaB / Rel family members make up the CD28 response complex transcription factor , other work has not supported this conclusion .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O
Recent studies suggest that the CD28 response element ( CD28RE ) does not function independently but works instead in conjunction with the adjacent promoter proximal AP - 1 - binding site and this hypothesis is confirmed here .,O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O
"Although four specific complexes can be detected binding to this sequence , only one of these complexes is specific for both the CD28RE and the adjacent AP - 1 site .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I O
"Of the NF - kappaB / Rel family members tested , this CD28RE / AP - 1 - specific complex contains predominantly c - Rel , despite the fact that both p50 and RelA can efficiently bind to the CD28RE .",O O B I I I I I I O O O B I I I I I I I O O B I I O O O O O O B O B O O O O O B O

"Thus , BOB . 1 / OBF . 1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is critically regulated by posttranslational modifications to mediate cell type - specific gene expression .",O O B I I I I I I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increased expression of Gs ( alpha ) enhances activation of the adenylyl cyclase signal transduction cascade .,O O O B I I I O O O O B I O O O O

It was observed that induction of G ( S ) alpha expression increased constitutive as well as stimulated cAMP accumulation .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O

"In this study , using a chromogenic assay , we have shown thrombin generation by apoptotic VSMCs expressing c - myc ( VSMC - myc ) with an area under the thrombin - generation curve ( AUC ) of 305 + / - 17 nmol x min / L and a peak thrombin ( PT ) of 154 + / - 9 nmol / L .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The thrombin - generating potential of the apoptotic VSMC - myc cells was greater than that of unactivated platelets ( P = . 003 for AUC ; P = . 0002 for PT ) and similar to calcium - ionophore activated platelets ( AUC of 332 + / - 15 nmol x min / L , P = . 3 ; PT of 172 + / - 8 nmol / L , P = . 2 ) .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thrombin activation was also seen with apoptotic human VSMCs ( AUC of 211 + / - 8 nmol x min / L ; PT of 103 + / - 4 nmol / L ) and was inhibited by annexin V ( P < . 0001 for AUC and PT ) .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
VSMC - myc cells maintained in serum generated less thrombin than after serum withdrawal ( P = . 0002 for AUC and PT ) .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that apoptotic VSMCs possess a significant thrombin - generating capacity secondary to phosphatidylserine exposure .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O

"The IL - 4 receptor ( IL - 4R ) in B cells is composed of two chains , the IL - 4 - binding IL - 4Ralpha chain , which is shared with the IL - 13R , and the IL - 2Rgamma ( gammac ) chain , which is shared with IL - 7R , IL - 9R , and IL - 15R .",O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I O
IL - 4 induces Cepsilon germline transcripts and IgE isotype switching in B cells from patients with gammac chain deficiency .,B I I O B I I O B I O O O O O O O B I O O
Induction of Cepsilon germline transcripts by IL - 4 in B cells that lack the gammac chain may involve signaling via the IL - 13R .,O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I O
"Alternatively , the IL - 4Ralpha chain may transduce intracellular signals that lead to Cepsilon gene transcription independently of its association with other chains .",O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
Disruption of the Jak1 - binding proline - rich Box1 region of IL - 4Ralpha abolished signaling by this chimeric receptor .,O O O B I I I I I I I O B I I O O O O B I O

"Whereas mutations in the GATA - 3 site abolished antigen - or cAMP - stimulated IL - 5 promoter activation in Th2 cells , ectopic expression of GATA - 3 in Th1 cells or in a non - lymphoid , non - IL - 5 - producing cell line activated the IL - 5 promoter .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"During the differentiation of naive CD4 ( + ) T cells isolated from T cell receptor transgenic mice , GATA - 3 gene expression was up - regulated in developing Th2 cells , but was down - regulated in Th1 cells , and antigen - or cAMP - activated Th2 cells ( but not Th1 cells ) expressed the GATA - 3 protein .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O

Constitutive DNA binding activity consisting of p50 homodimers was detected in nuclear extracts from both cell types .,O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O

"ALY , a context - dependent coactivator of LEF - 1 and AML - 1 , is required for TCRalpha enhancer function .",B O O B I I I O B I I O B I I O O O O B I O O
LEF - 1 is a transcription factor that participates in the regulation of the T - cell receptor alpha ( TCR alpha ) enhancer by facilitating the assembly of multiple proteins into a higher order nucleoprotein complex .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O B I O O O O B I O

"CD40 is a receptor that is critical for the survival , growth , differentiation , and isotype switching of B lymphocytes .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Although CD40 lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation , which is necessary for several CD40 - mediated events .",O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
We show that engagement of CD40 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak3 as well as of STAT3 .,O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O B O

A consensus sequence for a negative glucocorticoid response element ( nGRE ) and a transcription activator protein - 2 binding site were noted within this footprint .,O B I O O B I I I O B O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O
Functional studies showed a 2 . 5 - fold increase in promoter activity when this 19 - bp binding site was deleted in the reporter constructs IL - 1beta / CAT and IL - 1beta / SV40 promoter / CAT .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I B I I B I O B I I B I I B I O
Dexamethasone ( 10 ( - 8 ) M ) repressed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) production by 75 % in the wild - type fragment but not in a deletion mutant lacking the 19 - bp site .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I O O B I I I O

"One of these subregions , NRE gamma , is active in both HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and Huh7 hepatoma cells and was found to be bound by a protein factor present in both cell types .",O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we show that the transcription factor RFX1 can bind to NRE gamma and transactivate the core promoter through this site .,O O O O O B I B O O O B I O O O B I O O O O
Mutations which abrogated the gene - suppressive activity of NRE gamma prevented RFX1 from binding to NRE gamma .,O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O B I O

Alteration of a single serine in the basic domain of the Epstein - Barr virus ZEBRA protein separates its functions of transcriptional activation and disruption of latency .,O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"ZEBRA , a member of the bZIP family of DNA - binding proteins , is a transcriptional activator capable of inducing expression from viral lytic cycle promoters .",B O O O O O B I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
It had previously been thought that ZEBRA ' s capacity to disrupt EBV latency resided primarily in its ability to activate transcription of genes that encode products required for lytic replication .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We investigated whether this may be partly explained by changes in expression of NF - kappaB with monocyte differentiation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
Freshly isolated monocytes constitutively expressed high levels of transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimer which decreased with time in culture in favor of the transcriptionally active p50 / p65 and p50 / RelB heterodimers .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O

Viral DNA synthesis and late gene expression were found to be defective in U937 cells infected with E1B 19K mutants compared with wild - type virus .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Early viral RNA splicing patterns also differ between wild - type and dl337 - infected cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , the defect in viral replication could be complemented by dl312 virus defective in E1A expression 4 days after infection with E1B mutants , suggesting persistence of the E1B mutant genome in the infected cells despite defective onset of the late phase of replication .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens is constitutive in professional antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) but can also be induced by interferon - gamma ( IFN - gamma ) on the majority of the non professional APCs ( e . g . fibroblasts ) .,O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have recently characterised a new factor called IK which is an efficient inhibitor of IFN - gamma induction of MHC class II antigens expression .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O
"Here , we demonstrate a novel role for IK in MHC class II expression since over - expression of this protein by stable transfection into human B cells led to a total disappearance of constitutive MHC class II mRNA expression .",O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
The class II transactivator ( CIITA ) is necessary for both constitutive and IFN - gamma induced MHC class II expressions .,O B I I O B O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O
Examination of CIITA mRNA in IK stably transfected clones revealed a marked reduction of CIITA mRNA transcription .,O O B I O B O O O O O O O O B I O O
Taken together these results demonstrate that the IK protein plays a key role in the constitutive expression of MHC class II antigens and that inhibition induced by IK is upstream of CIITA in this regulatory pathway .,O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O
Selective expression of an interleukin - 12 receptor component by human T helper 1 cells .,O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O
"Interleukin - 12 ( IL - 12 ) , a heterodimeric cytokine produced by activated monocytes and dendritic cells , plays a crucial role in regulating interferon ( IFN ) - gamma production and in the generation of IFN - gamma - producing T helper 1 ( Th1 ) cells .",B I I O B I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Here we show that the IL - 12 receptor ( IL - 12R ) beta 2 subunit , a recently cloned binding and signal transducing component of the IL - 12R , is expressed on human Th1 but not Th2 clones and is induced during differentiation of human naive cells along the Th1 but not the Th2 pathway .",O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O B I I I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The selective expression and regulation of the IL - 12R beta 2 subunit may help to understand the basis of Th1 / Th2 differentiation and may provide therapeutic options for altering the Th1 / Th2 balance in several immuno - pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies .,O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The T cell activation factor NF - ATc positively regulates HIV - 1 replication and gene expression in T cells .,O B I I I B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Transcription mediated by NFAT is highly inducible in effector CD4 + T helper 2 ( Th2 ) cells but not in Th1 cells .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Transcriptional factors of the NFAT family play an important role in regulating the expression of several cytokine genes during the immune response , such as the genes for interleukin 2 ( IL - 2 ) and IL - 4 , among others .",B I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O O B I I O O O O
"Upon antigen stimulation , precursor CD4 + T helper ( pTh ) cells proliferate and differentiate into two populations of effector cells ( eTh1 and eTh2 ) , each one expressing a specific pattern of cytokines that distinguishes them from their precursors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Here we have used reporter transgenic mice to show that DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFAT are transiently induced during the differentiation of pTh cells into either eTh1 or eTh2 cells to mediate the expression of IL - 2 as a common growth factor in both pathways .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast to activated pTh cells , neither eTh1 nor eTh2 cells produced significant IL - 2 upon stimulation , but the high levels of NFAT transcriptional activities directly correlate with the IL - 4 production induced in response to antigen stimulation in eTh2 cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"These data suggest that activated NFAT is involved in the effector function of eTh2 cells and that the failure of eTh1 cells to produce IL - 4 in response to an antigen is due , at least partially , to a failure to induce high - level transcription of the IL - 4 gene by NFAT .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O

No degradation of p105 and p100 inhibitors was observed under these conditions .,O O O B I I I O O O O O O
"The transduction pathway leading to NF - kappaB activation in U937 cells involved the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , as demonstrated by the concomitant inhibitory effects of antioxidants on NF - kappaB activation and the emission of a fluorescent probe reacting intracellularly with hydrogen peroxide .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A negative role for phosphoinositide 3 - kinase in T - cell antigen receptor function .,O O O O B I I I O B I I I I O O
BACKGROUND : A delicate balance between positive and negative regulatory mechanisms during T - cell activation determines the specificity and magnitude of an immune response .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI 3 - kinase ) is activated by a diverse set of receptors that determine T - cell function , including the T - cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) , the costimulatory receptor CD28 , and negative regulators of T - cell activation such as CTLA - 4 .",B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O B I I O O B I O O O O O O O B I I O
PI 3 - kinase is also regulated by the haematopoietic cytokines that determine T - cell differentiation and lymphocyte proliferation .,B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PI 3 - kinase can thus dynamically influence the outcome of the immune reactions at various stages .,B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we investigated the importance of PI 3 - kinase in TCR - directed T - cell activation using activated or inhibitory versions of PI 3 - kinase .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
RESULTS : Certain aspects of TCR responses such as the induction of transcriptional activity of AP1 and serum response factor were not affected by expression of the mutant forms of PI 3 - kinase .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"We found , however , that PI 3 - kinase profoundly influenced the transactivation capacity of ' nuclear factor of activated T cells ' ( NF - AT ) elicited by the TCR : expression of an activated form of PI 3 - kinase inhibited TCR - mediated NF - AT responses , whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3 - kinase potently enhanced TCR - controlled NF - AT induction .",O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O B I I O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B O O B I I O O
"These effects of PI 3 - kinase were not mediated by previously identified PI 3 - kinase effectors , such as protein kinase B , a positive regulator of PI 3 - kinase , or the GTPase Rac , and are therefore likely to involve a novel , as yet unknown , effector molecule .",O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I O O O B I I O O B I O B I I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
The Pax - 5 gene is alternatively spliced during B - cell development .,O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
The transcription factor Pax - 5 is expressed during the early stages of B - cell differentiation and influences the expression of several B - cell - specific genes .,O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
"In addition to the existing isoform ( Pax - 5 , which we have named Pax - 5a ) , we have isolated three new isoforms , Pax - 5b , Pax - 5d , and Pax - 5e , from murine spleen and B - lymphoid cell lines using library screenings and polymerase chain reaction amplification .",O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Isoforms Pax - 5b and Pax - 5e have spliced out their second exon , resulting in proteins with only a partial DNA - binding domain .",O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Isoforms Pax - 5d and Pax - 5e have deleted the 3 ' - region , which encodes the transactivating domain , and replaced it with a novel sequence .",O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The existence of alternative Pax - 5 transcripts was confirmed using RNase protection assays .,O O O O B I I I O O O B O O O
"Furthermore , Pax - 5a and Pax - 5b proteins were detected using Western blot analysis .",O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O O
"Mobility shift assays showed that in vitro translated Pax - 5a and Pax - 5d , but not Pax - 5b or Pax - 5e , could interact with a B - cell - specific activator protein - binding site on the blk promoter .",O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O B I O

Reconstitution of T cell antigen receptor - induced Erk2 kinase activation in Lck - negative JCaM1 cells by Syk .,O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B O
We have previously reported that the activation of Syk is less dependent on the Src family kinase Lck than the activation of Zap .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I B O O O O B O
Here we report that overexpression of Syk in the Lck - negative JCaM1 cells enabled the T cell antigen receptor / CD3 complex to induce a normal activation of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway and expression of a nuclear factor of activated T cells reporter construct .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O
"In contrast , Zap and other protein - tyrosine kinases were unable to reconstitute these signaling pathways when expressed at the same levels .",O O O B O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In parallel , Syk was phosphorylated on tyrosine , while Zap was not .",O O O B O O O O O O B O O O
The Syk - mediated T cell antigen receptor - induced MAPK activation was detectable within 1 min of receptor stimulation and peaked at 3 - 5 min .,O B O O B I I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The capacity of Syk to reconstitute the MAPK response required the catalytic activity of Syk , an intact autophosphorylation site ( Y518 and Y519 ) , both Src homology 2 domains and it was blocked by the inhibitory N17 - mutated dominant - negative Ras construct .",O O O B O O O B O O O O O O B O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O
"A Y341 - - > F mutant of Syk , which is deficient in its interaction with phospholipase Cy1 and Vav , was less efficient than wild - type Syk .",O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O B I I I O
"Our results suggest that Syk , in contrast to Zap , can transduce signals from the T cell antigen receptor independently of Lck .",O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I O O B O
Activation of the transcription factor MEF2C by the MAP kinase p38 in inflammation .,O O O B I B O O B I I O O O
"For cells of the innate immune system to mount a host defence response to infection , they must recognize products of microbial pathogens such as lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , the endotoxin secreted by Gram - negative bacteria .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These cellular responses require intracellular signalling pathways , such as the four MAP kinase ( MAPK ) pathways .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O
In mammalian cells the MAPK p38 is thought to play an important role in the regulation of cellular responses during infection through its effects on the expression of proinflammatory molecules .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Here we demonstrate a link between the p38 pathway and a member of the myocyte - enhancer factor 2 ( MEF2 ) group of transcription factors .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O B I O
"We found that in monocytic cells , LPS increases the transactivation activity of MEF2C through p38 - catalysed phosphorylation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O
One consequence of MEF2C activation is increased c - jun gene transcription .,O O O B O O O B I I I O O
Our results show that p38 may influence host defence and inflammation by maintaining the balance of c - Jun protein consumed during infection .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
Cellular redox status influences both cytotoxic and NF - kappa B activation in natural killer cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The role of cellular redox status in both cytotoxic activity and NF - kappa B activation in natural killer ( NK ) cells was investigated .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"The results indicate that stimulation of NK cells , either freshly isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) or long - term cultured NK clones , with specific cell targets results in an increased binding activity of NF - kappa B and AP - 1 transcription factors measured by gel retardation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I B I O O O O O
Pretreatment of NK cells with the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbarmate ( PDTC ) leads to the inhibition of NF - kappa B activation but the AP - 1 binding to DNA was superinduced .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O
The inhibition of NF - kappa B by PDTC paralleled with an inhibition of spontaneous cytotoxicity mediated by NK cells .,O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Moreover , the inhibitors of serine proteases , N - alpha - tosyl - L - lysine chloromethyl ketone and N - alpha - tosyl - L - phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone , also blocked the cytolytic activity of NK cells against the sensitive target K562 .",O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , NK activity was not affected by pretreatment of the effector cells with the proteasome inhibitor N - acetyl - leu - leu - norleucinal which selectively inhibits NF - kappa B activation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
The E2F family of transcription factors are thought to play an important role in the control of cell cycle progression .,O B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is now also increasing evidence that some family members may act as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O
The characterization of these proteins in human primary haemopoietic cells and acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) blasts may thus give an insight to the molecular mechanisms governing proliferation and leukaemogenesis in these cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore we analysed the expression of E2F - DNA binding activity and the constituent proteins found in the complexes in human primary haemopoietic cells of various lineages .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"On electromobility shift assays ( EMSA ) a single E2F - DNA binding complex was detected in T cells , B cells and monocytes which was shown to contain E2F - 4 , DP - 1 and p130 , indicating that all quiescent haemopoietic cells have the same complex .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
Examination of 18 AML samples by EMSA revealed the presence of E2F binding and no gross abnormalities were detected .,O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Thus abnormalities of E2F function are unlikely to play a primary pathogenic role in AML .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Upon stimulation by various agents , I kappaB is proteolyzed and NF - kappaB translocates to the nucleus , where it activates its target genes .",O O O O O O B I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We demonstrate that upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide , Taxol , phorbol myristate acetate , interleukin - 1 , or double - stranded RNA , I kappaB alpha is not degraded , as a result of an absence of induced phosphorylation on serines 32 and 36 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Neither a mutation in I kappaB alpha nor a mutation in p50 or relA , the two major subunits of NF - kappaB in this cell line , accounts for this phosphorylation defect .",O O O O B I I O O O O B O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"As well as culminating in the inducible phosphorylation of I kappaB alpha on serines 32 and 36 , all the stimuli that are inactive on 1 . 3E2 cells exhibit a sensitivity to the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"RANTES ( regulated upon activation , normal T cell expressed and secreted ) is a cytokine that belongs to the beta - chemokine family ; it is chemoattractant for CD4 + / CD45RO T cells , it is produced by various cell types including CD8 + and CD4 + T cells as well as monocytes / macrophages , and has recently been shown to suppress replication of macrophage - tropic strains of HIV in CD4 + T cells .",B O B I I I I I I I I I O O O B O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"TIMP - 1 suppression of PCD is not due to metalloproteinase inhibition , as reduction and alkylation of the TIMP - 1 did not abolish this activity .",B I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
"Retroviral induction of TIMP - 1 not only resulted in cell survival but also in continued DNA synthesis for up to 5 d in the absence of serum , while controls underwent apoptosis .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This resistance to apoptosis is reversed by anti - TIMP - 1 antibodies , demonstrating that secreted TIMP - 1 is active in blocking apoptosis .",O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O

In vivo function of an interleukin 2 receptor beta chain ( IL - 2Rbeta ) / IL - 4Ralpha cytokine receptor chimera potentiates allergic airway disease .,O O O O O B I I I I B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O
"Strength of T cell receptor ( TCR ) signaling , coreceptors , costimulation , antigen - presenting cell type , and cytokines all play crucial roles in determining the efficiency with which type 2 T lymphocytes ( Th2 , Tc2 ) develop from uncommitted precursors .",O O B I I O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"This chimera transduced IL - 4 - specific signals in response to IL - 2 binding and dramatically enhanced type 2 responses ( IL - 4 , IL - 5 , and immunoglobulin E production ) upon in vitro TCR stimulation or in vivo antigen challenge .",O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O O

Differentiation - dependent expression of a human carboxylesterase in monocytic cells and transcription factor binding to the promoter .,O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O B O
Carboxylesterases play an important role in defense and clearance mechanisms of the monocyte / macrophage system .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During the differentiation process of cells from the monocytic cell line THP - 1 we observed a transient transcriptional upregulation of a human carboxylesterase analyzed by means of Northern blots .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
In PMA - treated THP - 1 cells we could detect three major transcription initiation sites as revealed by Nuclease Protection Assay carried out with two overlapping antisense RNA probes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis we demonstrated that the promoter region spanning base pairs - 1 to - 275 , which contains several putative binding sites for transcription factors , is bound by nuclear factors Sp1 and IRBP but not by C / EBPs .",O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I B O B O O O B I I O
Taken together these data indicate that carboxylesterase gene transcription in THP - 1 cells starts at multiple initiation sites and that Sp1 and IRBP may be critical factors for modulating the differentiation - dependent transcription of this human carboxylesterase gene .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"The Ikaros gene , which encodes a family of hemopoietic - specific zinc finger proteins , is described as a central regulator of lymphocyte differentiation .",O B I O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"During fetal development , it is required at the earliest stage of T cell and B cell specification .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , lack of natural killer cells and selective defects in gamma delta T cells and dendritic antigen - presenting cells point to Ikaros as an essential factor for the establishment of early branchpoints of the T cell pathway .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dominant interference activity of Ikaros isoforms unable to bind DNA and their effects in lymphocyte development suggest that Ikaros works in concert with other factors .,O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
A model is proposed that defines Ikaros as the backbone of a complex regulatory protein network that controls cell fate decisions and regulates homeostasis in the hemo - lymphoid system .,O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The caprine arthritis - encephalitis virus ( CAEV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) is activated by gamma interferon ( IFN - gamma ) in promonocytic cells .,O B I I I I I I I I I I O B O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O
We have previously shown that a 70 - bp element is necessary and sufficient for the response of the CAEV LTR to this cytokine .,O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O
"At the 5 ' end , this 70 - bp IFN - gamma response element contains sequence similarity to the gamma activated site ( GAS ) .",O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O B I I O B O O
Here we demonstrate that the putative GAS element in the CAEV LTR binds specifically to a cellular factor induced by IFN - gamma in promonocytic cells .,O O O O O O B I O O B I O O O O B I O O B I I O O O O
The GAS element from the 70 - bp motif is sufficient to confer responsiveness to IFN - gamma using a heterologous minimal promoter .,O B I O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
"Consistent with the binding data , the same mutations in the GAS element eliminate responsiveness to IFN - gamma in the context of both a functional CAEV LTR and a heterologous promoter .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I O O B I O
The cellular factor that binds to the GAS element is present from 5 min to 14 h after stimulation with IFN - gamma .,O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Binding of the nuclear factor to the GAS element in the CAEV LTR is inhibited by antibody directed against STAT1 ( p91 / 84 ) .,O O O O O O O B I O O B I O O O O O O B O B I I O O
"Thus , the GAS sequence in the CAEV LTR is essential for the response to IFN - gamma and a STAT1 - like factor binds to this site .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O
The STAT - 1 signaling pathway provides at least one mechanism for activation of the CAEV LTR by IFN - gamma in monocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O O O

A reduced expression of the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) in parathyroid glands of uremic animals and humans has been observed .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similar results have been obtained by our own group in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism to chronic renal failure .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , the reasons for these changes are not clear .",O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , VDR concentration was significantly decreased in A - CRF ( 0 . 8 + / - 0 . 5 fmol / 10 ( 7 ) cells vs . 2 . 3 + / - 0 . 9 fmol / 10 ( 7 ) cells in controls , p < 0 . 001 ) , whereas no changes were seen in M - CRF ( 1 . 7 + / - 0 . 7 fmol / 10 ( 7 ) cells vs . 2 . 3 + / - 0 . 9 fmol / 10 ( 7 ) cells in controls ) .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment with two different schedules of oral calcitriol ( five patients with 0 . 5 microgram / day for 1 month and four patients with 2 micrograms / day for 7 days ) did not change VDR concentrations .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
"We conclude that the low levels of serum 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 of uremia are not responsible for the decrease in VDR concentration found in these patients .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Transcription factor binding to the core promoter of the human monoamine oxidase B gene in the cerebral cortex and in blood cells .,B I O O O B I O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O
Many studies show that monoamine oxidase B in blood cells is a biological marker for personality characteristics such as sensation seeking .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism underlying this association is so far not explored .,O O O O O O O O O O O
In the present study we have performed electrophoretic mobility - shift assays to investigate the pattern of protein binding to a 150 bp fragment of the proximal 5 ' - flanking region of the human monoamine oxidase B gene .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I O O B I I I I O
We compared the pattern using nuclear extracts from human brain and lymphocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"As occurs for HL - 60 cell differentiation induced by high phorbol ester concentration , the ciprofibrate - induced phorbol ester - dependent differentiation of HL - 60 cells proceeded through the monocytic / macrophage pathway and induced the phosphorylation of proteins with similar molecular weights suggesting that increased protein kinase C activity may be involved in the effect .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
"The peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPARalpha ) transcription factor is expressed in HL - 60 cells , but no changes were observed in its expression upon HL - 60 cell differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The involvement of multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFR ) - associated factors in the signaling mechanisms of receptor activator of NF - kappaB , a member of the TNFR superfamily .",O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O B I O
Receptor activator of NF - kappaB ( RANK ) is a recently identified member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is expressed on activated T cells and dendritic cells .,B I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Its cognate ligand ( RANKL ) plays significant roles in the activation of dendritic cell function and osteoclast differentiation .,O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We demonstrate here the interaction of RANK with tumor necrosis factor receptor - associated factors ( TRAFs ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 both in vitro and in cells .",O O O O O O B O B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O
Mapping of the structural requirements for TRAF / RANK interaction revealed multiple TRAF binding sites clustered in two distinct domains in the RANK cytoplasmic tail .,O O O O O O B B I O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O
These TRAF binding domains were shown to be functionally important for the RANK - dependent induction of NF - kappaB and c - Jun NH2 - terminal kinase activities .,O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I O B I I B I I I O O
Site - directed mutagenesis demonstrated that these TRAF binding sites exhibited selective binding for different TRAF proteins .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I O
"When this membrane - proximal TRAF6 interaction domain was deleted , RANK - mediated NF - kappaB signaling was completely inhibited while c - Jun NH2 - terminal kinase activation was partially inhibited .",O O B I I I I I O O O B O O B I I O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O
"An NH2 - terminal truncation mutant of TRAF6 inhibited RANKL - mediated NF - kappaB activation , but failed to affect constitutive signaling induced by receptor overexpression , revealing a selective role for TRAF6 in ligand - induced activation events .",O B I I I I O B O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
Stat6 inhibits human interleukin - 4 promoter activity in T cells .,B O O B I I I O O O O O
"The differentiation of naive T - helper ( Th ) cells into cytokine - secreting effector Th cells requires exposure to multiple signals , including exogenous cytokines .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) plays a major role in this process by promoting the differentiation of IL - 4 - secreting Th2 cells .,B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
"In Th2 cells , IL - 4 gene expression is tightly controlled at the level of transcription by the coordinated binding of multiple transcription factors to regulatory elements in the proximal promoter region .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I O
Nuclear factor of activated T cell ( NFAT ) family members play a critical role in regulating IL - 4 transcription and interact with up to five sequences ( termed P0 through P4 ) in the IL - 4 promoter .,B I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
We report here that Stat6 interacts with three binding sites in the human IL - 4 promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assays .,O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O
"These sites overlap the P1 , P2 , and P4 NFAT elements .",O O O O B I I I I I I I O
"To investigate the role of Stat6 in regulating IL - 4 transcription , we used Stat6 - deficient Jurkat T cells with different intact IL - 4 promoter constructs in cotransfection assays .",O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O

Epithelial cell - initiated inflammation plays a crucial role in early tissue damage in amebic infection of human intestine .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND & AIMS : Entamoeba histolytica infection of the intestine can induce severe gut inflammation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The aims of this study were to assess the role of the host inflammatory response in the tissue damage observed with amebiasis and the role of the intestinal epithelial cell in initiating that response .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS : E . histolytica infection was established in human intestinal xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID - HU - INT ) mice .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Human intestinal epithelial cell inflammatory responses to amebic infection were inhibited by the intraluminal administration of an antisense oligonucleotide to the human p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB , and the role of neutrophils in tissue damage observed with amebiasis was studied by depleting neutrophils from SCID - HU - INT mice .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Inhibition of the gut inflammatory response by the antisense oligonucleotide or the depletion of neutrophils from SCID - HU - INT mice blocked the increase in intestinal permeability observed with amebic infection .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Triptolide induces apoptotic death of T lymphocyte .,O O O O O O O O

Recent studies have demonstrated that triptolide is the major active component in the extract that inhibits antigen or mitogen - induced T cell proliferation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
"In attempting to investigate its effect on activation of T lymphocytes , we found triptolide induces apoptotic death of T cell hybridomas and peripheral T cells but not that of thymocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , enforced expression of Bcl - 2 inhibited triptolide - induced degradation of PARP and apoptosis .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O O O

"We have shown previously that amplified expression of the B2 subunit of the V - ATPase occurs solely by increased transcription , and that the 5 ' - untranslated region of the B2 gene , containing multiple consensus binding sites for the transcription factors AP - 2 and Sp1 , is required for this expression .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I O O O B I I O O B I B I I O B O O O O O O O
"The present study demonstrates that AP - 2 binding sequences are essential for increased transcription from the B2 promoter during monocyte - macrophage differentiation and that AP - 2 , expressed exogenously in THP - 1 and other cells , activates transcription from the B2 promoter .",O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Bone marrow samples from 33 patients affected by MM and MGUS , and 8 patients not affected by lymphoproliferative diseases were studied for expression of c - Jun ( a component of the transcription factor AP - 1 ) and glutathione - S - transferase pi ( GST - pi ) using immunocytochemical methods .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I B I I O O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O
A high and frequent expression of these two proteins was found both in MM and MGUS patients ( 31 / 33 patients positive for c - Jun and 29 / 33 patients positive for GST - pi ) and in controls not affected by monoclonal gammopathy ( 7 / 8 patients positive for both c - Jun and GST - pi ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O
No statistically significant correlation was found between c - Jun - and GST - pi - positive plasma cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Using Wp reporter constructs in in vitro transfection assays , we found that Wp was 11 - to 190 - fold more active in B cell than in non - B cell lines and that three regions of the promoter ( termed UAS1 , UAS2 , and UAS3 ) contributed to transcriptional activation .",O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O B O O B O O O O O O

Engagement of the Lewis X antigen ( CD15 ) results in monocyte activation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Heat - shock for 2 hours at 42 degrees C , or the administration for 3 hours of 100 or 150 microM cadmium chloride , inhibited the subsequent proliferation activity , induced the expression of functional differentiation markers , and caused an increase in the amount of the stress - responsive HSP70 protein in U - 937 human promonocytic cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O
"In addition , both heat and cadmium produced an increase in the amount of the intermediate filament protein vimentin , as determined by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B O O O O O O O O O
"By contrast , the amounts of actin and beta - tubulin were not significantly altered .",O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O
"The amount of vimentin mRNA was also increased during recovery from stress , indicating that vimentin expression was not exclusively regulated at the protein level .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
"Although cadmium caused an early , transient stimulation of c - jun and c - fos expression and AP - 1 binding activity , heat - shock failed to alter both protooncogene expression and transcription factor binding , indicating that the stress - induced vimentin increase was not the result of AP - 1 - mediated transcriptional activation .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O

"Cytokine - induced modulation of PML expression was assessed by Northern blot analyses , flow cytometry studies and in situ immunolabelling .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In situ immunolabelling revealed that upregulation of protein expression by IFN - alpha is a consequence of a marked increase in both the number and the intensity of the staining of so - called PML nuclear bodies .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

Tpl - 2 induces IL - 2 expression in T - cell lines by triggering multiple signaling pathways that activate NFAT and NF - kappaB .,B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O
The Tpl - 2 kinase activates the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) and induces IL - 2 expression in T - cell lines .,O B I I I O O B I I I I I O B O O O B I I O O O O O O O
Here we show that the activation of the IL - 2 promoter by Tpl - 2 is inhibited by mutant signaling molecules that inhibit the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) or the calcineurin / NFAT pathways and is promoted by combinations of signaling molecules that activate these pathways .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O B I I O O O B I I I I O B O O O B B I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O

"While the activation of the IL - 2 promoter and an NFAT - driven minimal promoter by Tpl - 2 was fully blocked by the dominant negative mutant NFAT delta418 , it was only partially blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A suggesting that the Tpl - 2 - mediated NFAT activation is under the control of a combination of calcineurin - dependent and independent pathways .",O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I O B I I O O O O O B I I B I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The JAK / STAT pathway is one of the signaling pathways implicated in mediating biological responses induced by these cytokines .,O B B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Previous studies have demonstrated that these cytokines predominantly activate an 80 kDa STAT5 isoform in mature granulocytes .,O O O O O O B O O O B I I I O O O O
"To better understand the role of STAT proteins during growth and differentiation of granulocytes , we evaluated differentiation of human CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo toward eosinophils and neutrophils .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"However , during maturation of both lineages ( days 21 and 28 ) , increased expression of a functionally distinct 80 kDa STAT5 isoform was observed , resulting in heterodimer DNA - binding complexes containing both the 94 and 80 kDa STAT5 proteins .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I O
The finding that functionally distinct isoforms of STAT5 are activated during the early and late differentiation stages of granulocytes suggests that they might be involved in regulating different biological functions in these cells .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The T - cell oncogenic protein HOX11 activates Aldh1 expression in NIH 3T3 cells but represses its expression in mouse spleen development .,O B I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"In sharp contrast , in B cells treated with the phorbol ester 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) , strong interactions between the X2 box and NF - X2 containing c - Fos were observed .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O B I I O O O
"As determined by transient expression and RNA analyses , the activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) also increased rates of transcription from the wild - type DRA promoter but not from a DRA promoter bearing clustered point mutations in the X2 box .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O O B I O
"Since the co - expression with a dominant negative c - Fos abolished the responsiveness to TPA , we conclude that activated transcription of the DRA gene depends on interactions between the X2 box and NF - X2 , which contains c - Fos .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I O B I I O O O B I I O

"The 5 ' - positive regulatory unit , consisting of the promoter and the 5 ' enhancer , is already active at the CD4 - CD8 - double - negative ( DN ) stage of development .",O B I I I I I O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , its activity becomes lower in the double - positive and a fraction of the CD4 + CD8int / - cell population , indicating that an additional enhancer , located in either the first or the third intron of the CD4 gene , is required for CD4 gene expression in this population .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O
The other studied regulatory element is the minimal CD4 silencer which inhibits CD4 gene expression in peripheral CD8 T lymphocytes .,O O O B I O O B I I O O B I O O O O O O O

In clinics these molecules are also used for their potencies in inducing apoptosis of malignant lymphoid cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Glucocorticoids are mediating their effects after binding to an intracellular receptor belonging to the steroid receptor superfamily : the glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) .,O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I O O B I O B O O
"Once activated , the GR , can mediate his effects through direct binding on the DNA or via protein / protein interactions with transcription factors .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O

The role of Stat4 in species - specific regulation of Th cell development by type I IFNs .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Type I IFNs ( IFN - alpha / beta ) , in addition to IL - 12 , have been shown to play an important role in the differentiation of human , but not mouse , Th cells .",B I I O B I I I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The molecular basis for this species specificity is that IFN - alpha / beta activate Stat4 in differentiating human , but not mouse , Th cells .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , restimulation of human Th2 lines and clones in the presence of IFN - alpha does not induce the production of IFN - gamma .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O
"These results suggest that activation of Stat4 , which is necessary for the differentiation of naive T cells into polarized Th1 cells , is not sufficient to induce phenotype reversal of human Th2 cells .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Molecular cloning of FKHRL1P2 , a member of the developmentally regulated fork head domain transcription factor family .",O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
Here we report the expression of a fork head domain protein in human T helper cells .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O
We cloned and characterized a fork head cDNA from human T helper cell mRNA using differential display RT - PCR .,O O O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O
The cDNA contains a 546 - nucleotide ( nt ) open reading frame ( ORF ) that codes for the carboxyl - terminal 180 amino acids ( aa ) of the recently identified fkhrl1 gene .,O O O O B I I I I I I I I O B O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O B I O
This ORF does not contain the characteristic DNA - binding domain found in members of the forkhead protein family .,O B O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I O
In - vitro transcription / translation of this cDNA expressed a protein of approximately 20 kDa .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
This antibody also recognizes in human T lymphocytes a 70 - kDa protein corresponding in size to that predicted for the fkhrl1 gene product .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
"Recently , the transcription factor GATA - 3 was shown to be selectively expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells and to augment Th2 - specific cytokines .",O O O B I B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Here , we show that loss of GATA - 3 expression by developing Th1 cells requires IL - 12 signaling through Stat4 and does not simply result from an absence of IL - 4 .",O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Moreover , we demonstrate a novel role for GATA - 3 in directly repressing Th1 development distinct from its positive actions on Th2 - specific cytokines .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
GATA - 3 inhibits Th1 cytokines by a cell - intrinsic mechanism that is not dependent on IL - 4 and that may involve repression of IL - 12 signaling .,B I I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O
"Thus , GATA - 3 expression and IL - 12 signaling are mutually antagonistic , which facilitates rapid dominance of one pathway during early Th development , producing a stable divergence in cytokine profiles .",O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Conserved elements containing NF - E2 and tandem GATA binding sites are required for erythroid - specific chromatin structure reorganization within the human beta - globin locus control region .,B I O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
Proper expression of the genes of the human beta - globin gene locus requires the associated locus control region ( LCR ) .,O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O B I I O B O O
"Structurally , the LCR is defined by the presence of four domains of erythroid - specific chromatin structure .",O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These domains , which have been characterized as DNase I hypersensitive sites ( HSs ) , comprise the active elements of the LCR .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O B O
The major focus of this research is to define the cis - acting elements which are required for the formation of these domains of unique chromatin structure .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Our previous investigations on the formation of LCR HS4 demonstrated that NF - E2 and tandem , inverted GATA binding sites are required for the formation of the native HS .",O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I O
Similarly arranged NF - E2 and tandem GATA sites are present within the core regions of the other human LCR HSs and are evolutionarily conserved .,O O B I I I I I I O O O O B I O O O B I I O O O O O
Using site - directed mutagenesis of human HSs 2 and 3 we have tested the hypothesis that these NF - E2 and GATA sites are common requirements for the formation of all LCR HSs .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O B I O
"We find that mutation of these elements , and particularly the GATA elements , results in a decrease or complete loss of DNase I hypersensitivity .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I O O
These data imply the presence of common structural elements within the core of each LCR HS which are required for erythroid - specific chromatin structure reorganization .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O

A procedure suitable for cloning labile mRNAs that contain AU motifs is presented ( AU - DD ) .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
AU - DD is an AU - motif - directed differential display that permits the identification of ARE - containing genes differentially expressed after cell activation .,B I I O O B I I I I I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O
It has been applied to peripheral blood monocytes and a T cell clone to isolate 59 cDNA fragments associated to activation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
Fourteen percent of isolated fragments belong to already known genes that certainly are cytokines and transduction / transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I I O
The remaining 86 % correspond to unknown genes of which 92 % have been confirmed to be differentially expressed .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O

Expression of transcription factors during sodium phenylacetate induced erythroid differentiation in K562 cells .,O O B I O O O O O O O O O O

"Likewise , the level of expression of the erythroid transcription factors GATA - 1 , GATA - 2 , NF - E2 , SCL and RBTN2 , all expressed in untreated K562 cells , did not increase during sodium phenylacetate induced erythroid differentiation .",O O O O O O O O B I I B I I O B I I O B I I O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The expression of the nuclear factors Evi - 1 and c - myb , known to inhibit erythroid differentiation , did not decrease .",O O O O B I B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"We conclude that sodium phenylacetate treatment of K562 cells increases gamma - globin mRNA and induces cell maturation as judged by morphology without affecting the expression of the erythroid transcription factors , some of which are known to be involved in the regulation of beta - like globin genes .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O

"Mutations in these binding sites can interfere with the viral response to cell activation signals , decrease LTR transcription , and inhibit viral replication .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
The 5 ' - UTR also interacts with a specific nucleosome that is rapidly displaced during transcriptional activation of the latent provirus .,O B I I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Engagement of any of these receptors induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a shared group of intracellular signaling proteins , including Vav , Cbl , p85 phosphoinositide 3 - kinase , and the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B O B O B I I I I O O O B I I B O B O
"We have examined changes in HS1 phosphorylation after differential stimulation of CD3 , CD2 , and CD28 to elucidate its role in T cells and to further delineate the signaling pathways recruited by these receptors .",O O O O O B O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Unlike ligation of CD3 , stimulation with anti - CD28 mAb or CHO cells expressing the CD28 ligands CD80 or CD86 did not lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 in Jurkat T cells .",O O O B O O O B I I I O O O O O B I B O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"Additionally , no tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 was induced by mitogenic pairs of anti - CD2 mAbs capable of activating the transcription factor NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I O B I I I I I O O
"In vivo studies indicated that CD3 - induced HSI phosphorylation was dependent upon both the Src family tyrosine kinase Lck and the tyrosine phosphatase CD45 , did not require MEK1 kinase activity , and was regulated by protein kinase C activation .",O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O B I I I B O O B I B O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Thus , although CD3 , CD28 , and CD2 activate many of the same signaling molecules , they differed in their capacity to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of HSI .",O O O B O B O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"Furthermore , activation - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 was not required for NFAT transcriptional activation .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : To further analyze the neonatal immune response to an antigenic challenge such as blood transfusion , c - fos and c - jun mRNA expression were analyzed in twelve in - vitro - stimulated normal cord blood and ten in - vitro - stimulated normal adult peripheral blood lymphocyte samples .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Lymphocyte samples were stimulated by either the mitogen phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) or the monoclonal antibody alphaCD3 .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O B O
Proliferation rate and Northern blot hybridization were employed .,O O O O O O O O O
"RESULTS : Cord lymphocytes revealed a greater proliferation rate with PHA and alphaCD3 than adult lymphocytes ( p = 0 . 0081 and 0 . 0023 , respectively ) .",O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Adult lymphocytes showed an equivalent increase in mRNA expression of c - fos and c - jun ( 140 + / - 25 and 155 + / - 31 % ) at 30 min post - PHA stimulation , while cord lymphocyte maximum c - fos and c - jun expression ( 82 + / - 6 and 142 + / - 12 % ) occurred at 15 min post - PHA stimulation ( c - fos , p = 0 . 0354 ; c - jun , p = 0 . 0112 ) .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
"CONCLUSION : Although cord lymphocyte proliferation rates were significantly greater than those of adult lymphocytes following stimulation , lymphocyte activation , as analyzed by c - fos and c - jun mRNA expression , appears similar in both cord and adult samples .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that cord lymphocyte activation exhibits an adult - type profile .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fcgamma receptor - mediated mitogen - activated protein kinase activation in monocytes is independent of Ras .,B I O O B I I I I O O O O O O B O
"Cross - linking of FcR with immune complexes leads , first to activation of protein - tyrosine kinases .",O O O O B O B I O O O O O O B I I I O
The molecular events that follow and that transduce signals from these receptors to the nucleus are still poorly defined .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have investigated the signal transduction pathway from Fc receptors that leads to gene activation and production of cytokines in monocytes .,O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B O O O
These responses were completely blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors .,O O O O O O B I O O
"In contrast , expression of dominant negative mutants of Ras and Raf - 1 , in these cells , did not have any effect on FcR - mediated nuclear factor activation , suggesting that the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway was not used by these receptors .",O O O O O B I I O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O
"However , MAPK activation was easily detected by in vitro kinase assays , after FcR cross - linking with immune complexes .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I O
"Using the specific MAPK / extracellular signal - regulated kinase kinase ( MAPK kinase ) inhibitor PD98059 , we found that MAPK activation is necessary for FcR - dependent activation of the nuclear factor NF - kappaB .",O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O B I B I I O
"These results strongly suggest that the signaling pathway from Fc receptors leading to expression of different genes important to leukocyte biology , initiates with tyrosine kinases and requires MAPK activation ; but in contrast to other tyrosine kinase receptors , FcR - mediated MAPK activation does not involve Ras and Raf .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O B I I O B O O B O O O O B O B O
"The molecular mechanism involved in the process of antigen - driven somatic hypermutation of Ig genes is unknown , but it is commonly believed that this mechanism is restricted to the Ig loci .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"B cell lymphomas commonly display multiple somatic mutations clustering in the 5 ' - regulatory region of BCL - 6 , a proto - oncogene encoding for a POZ / Zinc finger transcriptional repressor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B cells and required for GC formation .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O O B I I O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To determine whether BCL - 6 mutations represent a tumor - associated phenomenon or reflect a physiologic mechanism , we screened single human tonsillar GC B cells for mutations occurring in the BCL - 6 5 ' - noncoding region and in the Ig variable heavy chain sequences .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O B I I I I O
"Accordingly , an expanded survey in lymphoid malignancies showed that BCL - 6 mutations are restricted to B cell tumors displaying GC or post - GC phenotype and carrying mutated Ig variable heavy chain sequences .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
These results indicate that the somatic hypermutation mechanism active in GC B cells physiologically targets non - Ig sequences .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
The AD1 and AD2 transactivation domains of E2A are essential for the antiapoptotic activity of the chimeric oncoprotein E2A - HLF .,O B O B O O O B O O O O O O O O B I B I I O
"The chimeric oncoprotein E2A - HLF , generated by the t ( 17 ; 19 ) chromosomal translocation in pro - B - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia , incorporates the transactivation domains of E2A and the basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) DNA - binding and protein dimerization domain of HLF ( hepatic leukemic factor ) .",O B I B I I O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O B O B I I O O
"To determine the structural motifs that contribute to this antiapoptotic effect , we constructed a panel of E2A - HLF mutants and programmed their expression in IL - 3 - dependent murine pro - B cells ( FL5 . 12 line ) , using a zinc - inducible vector .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In the context of a bZIP domain defective in DNA binding , mutants retaining either of the two transactivation domains of E2A were able to extend cell survival after growth factor deprivation .",O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O B I O O
"Thus , the block of apoptosis imposed by E2A - HLF in pro - B lymphocytes depends critically on the transactivating regions of E2A .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I O B O
"Since neither DNA binding nor protein dimerization through the bZIP domain of HLF is required for this effect , we propose mechanisms whereby protein - protein interactions with the amino - terminal region of E2A allow the chimera to act as a transcriptional cofactor to alter the expression of genes regulating the apoptotic machinery in pro - B cells .",O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Induction of Mn SOD in human monocytes without inflammatory cytokine production by a mutant endotoxin .,O O B I O O O O B I O O O B I O
"Endotoxin selectively induces monocyte Mn superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) without affecting levels of Cu , Zn SOD , catalase , or glutathione peroxidase .",B O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O B I O B O O B I O
"However , little is known about the structure - activity relationship and the mechanism by which endotoxin induces Mn SOD .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
In this study we demonstrated that a mutant Escherichia coli endotoxin lacking myristoyl fatty acid at the 3 ' R - 3 - hydroxymyristate position of the lipid A moiety retained its full capacity to coagulate Limulus amoebocyte lysate compared with the wild - type E . coli endotoxin and markedly stimulated the activation of human monocyte nuclear factor - kappaB and the induction of Mn SOD mRNA and enzyme activity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I O O O O
"However , in contrast to the wild - type endotoxin , it failed to induce significant production of tumor necrosis factor - alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein - 1alpha by monocytes and did not induce the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of mitogen - activated protein kinase .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
Regulation of the vitellogenin gene B1 promoter after transfer into hepatocytes in primary cultures .,O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
The estrogen - dependent and tissue - specific regulation of the Xenopus laevis vitellogenin gene B1 promoter has been studied by lipid - mediated DNA transfer into Xenopus hepatocytes in primary culture .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Hepatocytes achieve an efficient hormonal control of this promoter through a functional interaction between the estrogen responsive elements and a promoter proximal region upstream of the TATA box , which is characterized by a high density of binding sites for the transcription factors CTF / NF - 1 , C / EBP and HNF3 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I I I O B I I O B O
DNA accessibility to restriction enzymes within the chromosomal copy of the vitellogenin gene B1 promoter shows that the estrogen responsive unit and the promoter proximal region are sensitive to digestion in uninduced and estrogen - induced hepatocytes but not in erythrocyte nuclei .,O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Together , these findings support the notion that chromatin configuration as well as the interplay of promoter elements mediate proper hormone - dependent and tissue - specific expression of the B1 vitellogenin gene .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Cytokines , IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 6 , IL - 7 , IL - 12 , and IL - 15 are key regulators of human peripheral blood T and NK cell activation and differentiation but the precise mechanisms that give rise to their differential activities within these cells are not clear .",B O B I I O B I I O B I I O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Recent studies reveal that a family of transcription factors , signal transducers and activators of transcription ( STATs ) directly mediate many cytokine signals .",O O O O O O O B I O B I I I I I O B O O O O B O O
We analyzed the activation of STATs in primary human T and NK cells by a variety of specific cytokines .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"We demonstrate that IL - 12 induces STAT4 only in freshly isolated primary NK cells , but not in primary T cells , consistent with the lack of the IL - 12 receptor in resting T cells .",O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
"In contrast , IL - 4 induces different C epsilon GAS DNA - protein binding complexes in both T and NK cells .",O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O
"Moreover , IL - 4 costimulation with IL - 2 or IL - 12 does not alter their own preferential GAS - like DNA binding patterns when C epsilon - , Fc gamma RI - , and SIE GAS motif containing oligonucleotide probes are compared , suggesting that induction of GAS - like DNA - protein binding complexes by IL - 2 , IL - 4 , and IL - 12 is highly selective and represents one important factor in determining specific gene activation .",O O B I I O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O B I I O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , IL - 6 and IL - 2 synergistically induce homo - and heterodimerized STAT1 alpha and STAT3 in both NK and T cells , consistent with their reported synergism in modulating perforin gene expression .",O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O

Our data provide evidence that the differential responses in gene expression and cell activation seen in primary NK and T cells on direct stimulation with different cytokines may be a direct result of distinct activation of STAT transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Expression of the CD95 ( APO - 1 / Fas ) ligand ( CD95L ) in activated T cells is a major cause of T cell activation - induced apoptosis .,O O O B I I I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To study the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control of CD95L expression in T cells , we investigated the human CD95L promoter in Jurkat T cells .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O
Deletion studies revealed that the CD95L proximal promoter sequence from - 220 to the transcription start site is essential for T cell stimulation - induced expression of CD95L .,O O O O O B I I I O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O
"In this study , we discovered a novel regulatory element located at - 120 of the CD95L promoter which contains DNA binding sites for SP - 1 and a yet unknown inducible factor .",O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O O B I O O B I I O B I I O O O O B I O
Mutation analysis demonstrated that binding of the inducible factor to the - 120 region is crucial for the biological function of the CD95L promoter upon T cell stimulation .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
"However , cotransfection studies with an NF - AT expression vector showed that NF - AT may confer a strong inducible activity to the CD95L promoter at this regulatory region .",O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O
Our data also show that the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A down - regulates CD95L transcription by inhibiting the function of this positive regulatory element,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I
"A nongenomic mechanism for progesterone - mediated immunosuppression : inhibition of K + channels , Ca2 + signaling , and gene expression in T lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism by which progesterone causes localized suppression of the immune response during pregnancy has remained elusive .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Using human T lymphocytes and T cell lines , we show that progesterone , at concentrations found in the placenta , rapidly and reversibly blocks voltage - gated and calcium - activated K + channels ( KV and KCa , respectively ) , resulting in depolarization of the membrane potential .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"As a result , Ca2 + signaling and nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF - AT ) - driven gene expression are inhibited .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O
"K + channel blockade by progesterone is specific ; other steroid hormones had little or no effect , although the progesterone antagonist RU 486 also blocked KV and KCa channels .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O

We propose that direct inhibition of K + channels in T cells by progesterone contributes to progesterone - induced immunosuppression .,O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Transgenic mice with human CD3epsilon gene have been shown to exhibit early arrest of T cell development in the thymus .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Hanging drop - mediated transfer into 2 - deoxyguanosine - treated thymus lobes showed that lymphoid progenitor cells rather than thymus stromal cells were responsible for abnormal B cell development in tg epsilon26 thymus , and that tg epsilon26 fetal liver cells were destined to become B cells in normal thymus even in the presence of normal progenitor cells undergoing T cell development .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Interestingly , tg epsilon26 thymocytes expressed GATA - 3 and TCF - 1 , but not LEF - 1 and PEBP - 2alpha , among T cell - specific transcription factors that are involved in early T cell development , indicating that GATA - 3 and TCF - 1 expressed during thymocyte development do not necessarily determine the cell fate into T cell lineage .",O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"In vitro studies identify three essential elements of the TATA - less blr1 core promoter that confer cell type - and differentiation - specific expression in the B cells of both humans and mice , a functional promoter region ( - 36 with respect to the transcription start site ) , a NF - kappaB motif ( + 44 ) , and a noncanonical octamer motif ( + 157 ) .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O

"Recently , we have reported that the histogenesis of B - cell lymphomas may be assessed by monitoring the expression pattern of BCL - 6 , a transcription factor expressed in germinal center ( GC ) B cells , and CD138 / syndecan - 1 ( syn - 1 ) , a proteoglycan associated with post - GC , terminal B - cell differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we have applied these two markers to the study of HD histogenesis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We have found that in nodular lymphocyte predominance HD ( NLPHD ) tumor cells consistently display the BCL - 6 ( + ) / syn - 1 ( - ) phenotype , indicating their derivation from GC B cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Conversely , classic HD ( CHD ) is heterogeneous because the tumor cells of a fraction of CHD display the BCL - 6 ( - ) / syn - 1 ( + ) phenotype of post - GC B - cells , whereas another fraction of CHD is constituted by a mixture of tumor cells reflecting the GC ( BCL - 6 ( + ) / syn - 1 ( - ) ) or post - GC ( BCL - 6 ( - ) / syn - 1 ( + ) ) phenotypes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O
"BCL - 6 ( - ) / syn - 1 ( + ) tumor cells of CHD are mostly found surrounded by T cells expressing CD40L , consistent with the observation that CD40 signaling downregulates BCL - 6 expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O B I I O O
"These data indicate that tumor cells of NLPHD uniformly display a GC B - cell phenotype , whereas the phenotype of tumor cells of CHD appears to be modulated by the surrounding cellular background , particularly CD40L + reactive T cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We have previously shown that the presence of the CD4 cytoplasmic tail is critical for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - induced apoptosis ( J . Corbeil , M . Tremblay , and D . D .

We have pursued our investigation of the role of the CD4 transduction pathway in HIV - induced apoptosis .,O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"To do this , wild - type and mutant forms of the CD4 cytoplasmic tail were stably expressed in the lymphoblastoid T - cell line A2 . 01 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Apoptosis was prevented when CD4 truncated at residue 402 was expressed ; however , cells expressing mutated receptors that do not associate with p56 ( lck ) ( mutated at the dicysteine motif and truncated at residue 418 ) but which conserved proximal domains of the cytoplasmic tail underwent apoptosis like wild - type CD4 .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I I O
The differences between wild - type and mutated receptors in the induction of apoptosis were not related to levels of p56 ( lck ) or NF - kappaB activation .,O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O
Initial signaling through the CD4 receptor played a major role in the sensitization of HIV - infected T cells to undergo apoptosis .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Incubation of HIV - infected cells with monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) 13B8 - 2 , which binds to CD4 in a region critical for dimerization of the receptor , prevented apoptosis without inhibiting HIV replication .",O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Moreover , the apoptotic process was not related to Fas - Fas ligand interaction ; however , an antagonistic anti - Fas MAb ( ZB - 4 ) enhanced apoptosis in HIV - infected cells without inducing apoptosis in uninfected cells .",O O O O O O O O O B B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These observations demonstrate that CD4 signaling mediates HIV - induced apoptosis by a mechanism independent of Fas - Fas ligand interaction , does not require p56 ( lck ) signaling , and may involve a critical region for CD4 dimerization .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B B I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B O O

"We conclude that although cell cycle arrest induced by alpha - IFN may be mediated in part by formation of a complex containing p130 and E2F - 4 , alpha - IFN does not induce hyperphosphorylation of E2F - 4 , which characterizes primary hemopoietic cells in G0 .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O

"During this process a sequence of cellular , humoral , non - specific and specific actions are evoked to combat the infection .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"MRP14 ( Macrophage migration inhibitory related protein ) and MRP8 , two S - 100 proteins contained in high concentrations in these cells are obviously essential for adhesion and migration of monocytes and granulocytes .",B O B I I I I O O B O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A CD28 - associated signaling pathway leading to cytokine gene transcription and T cell proliferation without TCR engagement .,O B O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B O O
Stimulation of resting human T cells with the CD28 - specific mAb BW 828 induces proliferation and cytokine synthesis without further requirement for TCR coengagement .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O B O O O O O B O O
"To test whether this putative function of CD28 is mediated via a particular signaling pathway , we compared early signaling events initiated in resting T cells by the stimulatory mAb BW 828 with signals triggered by the nonstimulating CD28 mAb 9 . 3 .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I I I O
"Stimulation of T cells with BW 828 induced an increase in intracellular Ca2 + , but did not lead to detectable activation of the protein kinases p56 ( lck ) and c - Raf - 1 .",O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I I O B I I I I O
"On the other hand , stimulation of T cells with mAb 9 . 3 increased the level of intracellular Ca2 + and triggered the activation of p56 ( lck ) and c - Raf - 1 , but was unable to induce the binding of transcription factors to the IL - 2 promoter .",O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I O
These data support the view that stimulation through CD28 can induce some effector functions in T cells and suggest that this capacity is associated with a particular pattern of early signaling events,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Decreased IL - 12 production and Th1 cell development by acetyl salicylic acid - mediated inhibition of NF - kappaB .,O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
This pro - inflammatory cytokine plays a prominent role in the development of Th1 cell - mediated immune responses .,O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thus , IL - 12 appears to be a critical factor in the generation and maintenance of chronic inflammatory conditions .",O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we investigated the effects of a commonly prescribed anti - inflammatory drug , acetyl salicylic acid ( ASA ) , on IL - 12 production and Th1 cell development .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
ASA was found to inhibit secretion of the IL - 12 heterodimer as well as p40 monomer by human monocytic cells .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I O O O O O
"Analysis of the regulation of the p40 gene promoter revealed that ASA inhibited NF - kappaB activation and binding to the p40 - kappaB site in the p40 promoter , leading to transcriptional repression of the p40 gene .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I O O B I O O O O O O O B I O
"Addition of ASA to an in vitro T helper cell differentiation system , at concentrations compatible with plasma levels reached during anti - inflammatory therapy , resulted in reduced development of Th1 cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that the inhibition of NF - kappaB activation by ASA leads to down - regulation of IL - 12 production and inhibition of Th1 cell development .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
Attenuation of HLA - DR expression by mononuclear phagocytes infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is related to intracellular sequestration of immature class II heterodimers .,O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
MHC class II expression was examined in macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis .,B I I O O O O O O O O O O
IFN - gamma increased the surface expression of class II molecules in THP - 1 cells and this was markedly reduced in cells infected with M . tuberculosis .,B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Despite this effect , steady state levels of HLA - DRalpha , HLA - DRbeta , and invariant ( Ii ) chains were equivalent in control and infected cells .",O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O
"In addition , in contrast to control cells , class II molecules in infected cells failed to colocalize with endocytosed BSA under conditions where this marker is known to label late endosomes , lysosomes , and the MHC class II compartment .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Consistent with defective transport along the endocytic pathway , the maturation of SDS - stable class II alphabeta dimers - - dependent upon removal of Ii chain and peptide loading of class II dimers in the MHC class II compartment - - was markedly impaired in M . tuberculosis - infected cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O B I O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings indicate that defective transport and processing of class II molecules through the endosomal / lysosomal system is responsible for diminished cell surface expression of MHC class II molecules in cells infected with M . tuberculosis .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
Identification of upstream regulatory elements that repress expression of adult beta - like globin genes in a primitive erythroid environment .,O O B I I O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O
"Our investigations have focused on localizing cis - elements responsible for the down regulation of the adult beta - like globin genes ( delta and beta ) in immature , or primitive erythroid tissues .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O B O O O O O O O O O
"We studied their activity after transfection into K562 cells , an erythroleukemia cell line with an embryonic - fetal phenotype .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Truncation of the beta globin promoter led to a 2 - 3 fold increase in promoter activity .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , deletion of the upstream portion of the delta promoter led to a 10 fold decrease in expression .",O O O O O O B I O O B I O O O O O O O O O
"Coupling of the upstream beta globin sequence from approximately - 500 to - 250 bp to the truncated delta promoter fragment led to complete extinction of transcription activity , consistent with a negative regulatory effect of the beta globin gene upstream element ( s ) .",O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O
Site - directed mutagenesis of binding sites for the repressor proteins BP1 and BP2 in the upstream portion of the beta globin gene flanking region led to a 4 - 6 fold increase in promoter activity .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
DNase I footprinting of the upstream delta - globin region revealed protected sequences corresponding to consensus binding sites for GATA - 1 and BP2 .,B I O O O B I I I I O B I O O B I I O B I I O B O
These results confirm that sequences in the upstream promoter region of the adult beta globin gene contribute to its factor - mediated suppression early in development and then may modulate its expression at a later stage .,O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analysis of cytokine signaling in patients with extrinsic asthma and hyperimmunoglobulin E .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O
BACKGROUND : Recent data suggest that the regulation of class switching to IgE by cytokines is mediated by STAT transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O B I I O
"OBJECTIVE : We hypothesized that in extrinsic asthma or in cases of markedly elevated IgE ( ie , hyperimmunoglobulin E [ HIE ] ) increased levels of IgE may be associated with alterations in the cytokine levels or the activation of Stat6 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O
"METHODS : PBMCs and sera from 8 patients with extrinsic asthma ( mean IgE , 285 + / - 100 IU / mL ) , 3 patients with HIE ( mean IgE , 7050 + / - 1122 IU / mL ) , and 14 nonatopic control subjects ( mean IgE , 112 + / - 28 IU / mL ) were analyzed .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"RESULTS : The mean IL - 4 level detected by ELISA was much greater in patients with HIE than control subjects ( 88 . 6 + / - 11 . 5 pg / mL vs 11 . 5 + / - 7 . 1 pg / mL , P = . 005 ) , and increased IL - 4 levels among patients with both asthma and HIE correlated with the increased IgE levels .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
"In contrast , IL - 13 levels were not elevated .",O O O B I I O O O O O
Levels of Stat6 protein present in PBMCs did not differ in the patients and control subjects .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Examination of Stat6 DNA - binding activity demonstrated no activation of IL - 4 signaling in patients with either HIE or acute asthma .,O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Interestingly , evidence for the presence of B cells that have already switched to IgE was seen in PBMCs of several patients with asthma or HIE .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"CONCLUSION : These results indicate that ( 1 ) IgE production in asthma and HIE usually is associated with elevated levels of IL - 4 , but not IL - 13 , in the peripheral blood ; ( 2 ) the increased sera IL - 4 levels in asthma and HIE are not sufficient to induce Stat6 activation in PBMCs ; and ( 3 ) evidence of switch recombination to epsilon may be detected in isolated cases of elevated IgE .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"This implies that high levels of IgE in these patients either results from B cells that have already undergone class switching , from Ig class switching that is localized to target tissues , or both .",O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Carboxyl - terminal 15 - amino acid sequence of NFATx1 is possibly created by tissue - specific splicing and is essential for transactivation activity in T cells .,B I I I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We have isolated NFATx , which is one of four members of the NFAT family of transcription factors and is preferentially expressed in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes , and an isoform of NFATx , NFATx1 .",O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O
Here we provide evidence showing that 15 amino acids in the carboxyl - terminal end of NFATx1 are required for its maximum transactivation activity in Jurkat T cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
A fusion between these 15 amino acids and the GAL4 DNA binding domain was capable of transactivating reporters driven by the GAL4 DNA binding site .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Interestingly , this 15 - amino acid transactivation sequence is well conserved in NFAT family proteins , although the sequences contiguous to the carboxyl - terminal regions of the NFAT family are much less conserved .",O O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I O O O O O
"NFATx1 is expressed predominantly in the thymus and peripheral blood leukocyte , while the skeletal muscle expressed primarily NFATx2 .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"In Jurkat cells , transcription from the NFAT site of the IL - 2 promoter is activated strongly by NFATx1 but only weakly by NFATx2 .",O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I O O O O B O O O O B O
These data demonstrate that the 15 - amino acid sequence of NFATx1 is a major transactivation sequence required for induction of genes by NFATx1 in T cells and possibly regulates NFAT activity through tissue - specific alternative splicing .,O O O O O B I I I I O B O O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Altered DNA - binding specificity mutants of EKLF and Sp1 show that EKLF is an activator of the beta - globin locus control region in vivo .,B I I I I I O B O O O O B O O O O O B I I I I I O O O
The locus control region of the beta - globin cluster contains five DNase I hypersensitive sites ( 5 ' HS1 - 5 ) required for locus activation .,O B I I O O B I I I O O B I I I O B I I I I O O O O O O
"Members of a protein family , characterized by three zinc fingers highly homologous to those found in transcription factor Sp1 , interact with these motifs .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
"Because point mutagenesis can not distinguish between family members , it is not known which protein activates 5 ' HS3 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Testing their activity in transgenic mice shows that EKLF is a direct activator of 5 ' HS3 .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O
The Epstein - Barr virus Rta protein activates lytic cycle genes and can disrupt latency in B lymphocytes .,O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O
"Overexpression of ZEBRA , the product of BZLF1 , is sufficient to disrupt latency in B lymphocytes and epithelial cells by stimulating expression of lytic cycle genes , including BRLF1 .",O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B O
The BRLF1 product Rta functions as a transcriptional activator in both B lymphocytes and epithelial cells .,O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , Rta has recently been reported to disrupt latency in an epithelial specific manner ( S . Zalani , E . Holley - Guthrie , and S . Kenney , Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci .

Here we demonstrate that expression of Rta is also sufficient for disruption of latency in a permissive B - cell line .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , Rta by itself is less potent than ZEBRA in the ability to activate most early and late lytic cycle genes .",O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"In light of previous work implicating ZEBRA in the activation of Rta , we suggest a cooperative model for EBV entry into the lytic cycle .",O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Transcription of a minimal promoter from the NF - IL6 gene is regulated by CREB / ATF and SP1 proteins in U937 promonocytic cells .,O O O B I O O B I I I O O O B I I O B I O O O O O
"NF - IL6 is an important transcriptional regulator of genes induced in activated monocytes / macrophages , and NF - IL6 is the only CCAAT / enhancer - binding protein ( C / EBP ) family member whose steady - state mRNA levels increase upon activation of monocytes ( 1 ) .",B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We show that increased transcription of the NF - IL6 gene is responsible , at least in part , for induction of NF - IL6 mRNA following activation of U937 promonocytic cells .",O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
We have identified a 104 - bp minimal promoter region of the NF - IL6 gene that is sufficient for basal and activation - dependent induction of transcription in U937 cells .,O O O O B I I I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This region contains binding sites for the cAMP response element - binding protein / activation transcription factor ( CREB / ATF ) and Sp1 families of transcription factors .,O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O B I I O O B O O B I O
Each site is functionally important and contributes independently to transcription of the NF - IL6 gene in U937 cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
CIITA B - cell - specific promoter suppression in MHC class II - silenced cell hybrids .,B B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , various sets of somatic cell hybrids , generated by the fusion of epithelial cell lines with B - lymphoblastoid cell lines , were analyzed for the expression of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II antigens .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O
"Using interspecies hybrids , the segregation of human chromosomes allowed us to establish that MHC class II extinction is linked to the presence in the hybrids of the chromosomes from the epithelial fusion partner .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
"Moreover , our data provide evidence that the expression pattern of MHC class II mRNA is correlated with that of the class II transactivator ( CIITA ) , suggesting that CIITA is the actual target of the silencing .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O
To gain further insight into the suppression phenomenon we performed luciferase assays which show that silencing affects the activity of the B - cell - specific promoter of CIITA .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O
"These results therefore demonstrate that the MHC class II gene silencing in somatic cell hybrids is due to an active suppression of one of the promoters of the CIITA gene , mediated by the epithelial cell fusion partner .",O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O
Class II transactivator - independent endothelial cell MHC class II gene activation induced by lymphocyte adhesion .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
"NK cells induce MHC class II molecules on the surface of allogeneic endothelial cells in an adhesion - dependent , IFN - gamma - independent manner .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O

RNA analysis in these cells and in a cell line that is defective in class II transactivator ( CIITA ) demonstrates that NK cell - induced HLA - DR alpha mRNA expression is also CIITA - independent .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O B O O O
"The Janus kinase - 1 - deficient cell line U4A expresses HLA - DR alpha mRNA in response to NK cell activation , and HLA - DR alpha promoter constructs transfected into these cells are induced by NK cells but not IFN - gamma .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O

The association and activation of the IL - 1 receptor - associated protein kinase ( IRAK ) to the IL - 1 receptor complex is one of the earliest events detectable in IL - 1 signal transduction .,O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O B O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
We generated permanent clones of the murine T cell line EL4 6 . 1 overexpressing human ( h ) IRAK to evaluate the role of this kinase in IL - 1 signaling .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Overexpression of hIRAK enhanced IL - 1 - stimulated activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB , whereas a truncated form ( N - IRAK ) specifically inhibited IL - 1 - dependent NFkappaB activity .",O O B O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O B O O
In clones stably overexpressing hIRAK a weak constitutive activation of NFkappaB correlated with a low basal IL - 2 production which was enhanced in an IL - 1 - dependent manner .,O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O

The ability to induce anergy in antigen - specific T cells has potential therapeutic value for altering pathologic immune responses .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study was undertaken to further analyze changes in cytokine production and intracellular signaling during anergy induction using high concentrations of native peptide ligand of tetanus toxoid ( TT ) - and myelin basic protein ( MBP ) - specific human T cell lines .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Specific glucocorticoid binding at different levels of human motor activity .,O O O O O O O O O O O

In the second series we observed the following : at the end of the first month of bed rest the number of glucocorticoid receptors and receptor affinity significantly increased ; at the beginning of the third month of bed rest specific glucocorticoid binding significantly decreased and circadian rhythms of adrenocorticotropin and cortisol in blood varied markedly ; at the end of the sixth month of bed rest the number of glucocorticoid receptors returned to prebed rest levels and dissociation constant decreased .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
In the third series physical exercises that induced an activation of the hypothalamic - hypophyseal - adrenocortical system ( maximal physical exercises and prolonged submaximal exercises at 70 % of maximal oxygen uptake ) led to a significant increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptors without changes of dissociation constant .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
These results indicate that both a decrease and an increase of human motor activity resulted in significant changes of specific glucocorticoid binding which were not influenced by changes of circulating hormone concentrations in blood but by some other factors affected by physical activity .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"We demonstrate in this report that overexpression of an activated form of Rho enhances AP - 1 activity in Jurkat T cells in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , but activated Rho ( V14Rho ) has little or no effect on NFAT , Oct - 1 , and NF - kappaB enhancer element activities under similar conditions .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O B O B I I O O B I I I I O O O O O
Overexpression of a V14Rho construct incapable of membrane localization ( CAAX deleted ) abolishes PMA - induced AP - 1 transcriptional activation .,O O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I O O O
"V14Rho binds strongly to protein kinase Calpha ( PKCalpha ) in vivo ; however , deletion of the CAAX site on V14Rho severely diminished this association .",B O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O
Evidence for a role for PKCalpha as an effector of Rho was obtained by the observation that coexpression of the N - terminal domain of PKCalpha blocked the effects of activated Rho plus PMA on AP - 1 transcriptional activity .,O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O B O O O B I I O O O

Changes in PKC isoforms in human alveolar macrophages compared with blood monocytes .,O O B I O O O O O O O O O
Alveolar macrophages play an important role in host defense and in other types of inflammatory processes in the lung .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found an increase in Ca2 + - dependent PKC isoforms in monocytes compared with alveolar macrophages .,O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O
We also found differential expression of the Ca2 + - independent isoforms in alveolar macrophages compared with monocytes .,O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O
One consequence of the activation of PKC can be increased expression of mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathways .,O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O
"Therefore , we also evaluated activation of the MAP kinase extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) 2 by the phorbol ester phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"PMA activated ERK2 kinase in both alveolar macrophages and monocytes ; however , monocytes consistently showed a significantly greater activation of ERK2 kinase by PMA compared with alveolar macrophages .",O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
Another known consequence of the activation of PKC and subsequent activation of ERK kinase is activation of the transcription factor activator protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) .,O O O O O O O B O O O O B I O O O O B I I I I I O B I I O O
We evaluated the activation of AP - 1 by PMA in both monocytes and macrophages .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
"We found very little detectable activation of AP - 1 , as assessed in a gel shift assay , in alveolar macrophages , whereas monocytes showed a substantial activation of AP - 1 by PMA .",O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O

Expression of gamma - IFN responsive genes in scavenger receptor over - expressing monocytes is associated with xanthomatosis .,O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Expression of gamma - interferon inducible protein 10 ( IP - 10 ) , a STAT1alpha - responsive gene and mediator of inflammatory response , was also abnormally expressed in the monocytes from II - 2 .",O O B I I I I I O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Over - expression of both genes was restricted to monocytes from II - 2 and was not observed in monocytes from the clinically unaffected family members , unlike that of SR .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Gel retardation assays with THP - 1 cell extracts identified gamma - IFN inducible DNA binding activity to three potential STATI DNA binding elements in the human IP - 10 promoter region from nucleotides - 245 to - 188 .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I I O B I I I I I O
Taken together these results suggest that gamma - interferon mediated cell activation is responsible for STAT1alpha - induced transcription of the IP - 10 gene in THP - 1 macrophages as well as in monocytes from II - 2 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Redox signals and NF - kappaB activation in T cells .,O O O B I I O O O O O
Accumulating data from a number of laboratories have recently indicated that the response of transcription factor NF - kappaB to alterations in the redox homeostasis of cells may play an important role in modulating immune function .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Diminished NF - kappaB activity has been shown to occur in T cells with aging , suggesting that impaired activation of NF - kappaB might occur during cellular senescence .",O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
"In addition , aberrancies in NF - kappaB activity have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of diseases involving immune or inflammatory processes such as atherosclerosis and HIV - 1 infection .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The role of H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as an integratory secondary messenger for divergent T cell signals has been complicated by the fact that various T cell lines and peripheral blood T cells differ markedly in the levels of NF - kappaB activation induced by oxidant stress .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
"Additionally , proposed pathways of NF - kappaB activation have been based on indirect evidence provided by experiments which used antioxidants to inhibit active NF - kappaB formation .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"Further , complete activation of T cells requires at least two signals , one that stimulates an increase in intracellular calcium and one that stimulates enzymatic processes including kinases .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Similarly , substantial evidence indicates that full activation of NF - kappaB requires dual signals .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
The ability of H2O2 or other ROS to induce T cell signals and functional responses by these two mechanisms is reviewed and the specific response of NF - kappaB to redox changes in T cells is examined .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O

"We recently determined that erythropoietin ( EPO ) activates 3 members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) family , Stat1alpha , Stat3 , and Stat5 , in the human EPO - dependent cell lines , UT - 7 and UT - 7 / EPO ( Kirito et al , J Biol Chem 272 : 16507 , 1997 ) .",O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In this study , we examined the roles of Stat1alpha and Stat3 in EPO - induced erythroid differentiation .",O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O O O O O

We found that EPO did not activate Stat1alpha or Stat3 in UT - 7 / GM cells .,O O O B O O O B O B O O O O O O O O
"Transfection experiments showed that both Stat1alpha and Stat3 inhibited the induction by EPO of gamma - globin and erythroid - specific 5 - aminolevulinate synthetase transcripts , resulting in a reduction of the percentage of hemoglobin - positive cells .",O O O O O B O B O O O O B O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"To determine the mechanism of action of Ro 09 - 2210 , we set up a transient expression system in Jurkat T cells using a variety of reporter gene constructs and showed effective inhibition of phorbol ester / ionomycin - induced NF - AT activation and anti - CD3 induced NF - AT with IC50 = 7 . 7 and 10 nM , respectively .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

"We further showed that Ro 09 - 2210 was unable to inhibit c - jun induced expression of AP1 - dependent reporter constructs ( IC50 > 500 nM ) , but was able to potently inhibit ras - induced AP1 activation ( IC50 = 20 nM ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O

"Stimulation of PPARgamma with troglitazone or 15 - deoxy - delta12 , 14 - prostaglandin J2 in human monocyte - derived macrophages inhibited MMP - 9 gelatinolytic activity in a concentration - dependent fashion as revealed by zymography .",O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This inhibition correlates with decreased MMP - 9 secretion as determined by Western blotting .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O

Occurrence of a silencer of the interleukin - 2 gene in naive but not in memory resting T helper lymphocytes .,O O O B O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
In the immune system the first activation of a naive T cell by antigen is a key step in the shaping of the peripheral T cell specificity repertoire and maintenance of self - tolerance .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In the present study , analysis of the interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) gene activation shows that naive human helper T cells ( cord blood CD4 + T cells , adult CD4 + CD45RO - T cells ) regulate IL - 2 transcription by a mechanism involving both a silencer and an activator acting on the purine - rich IL - 2 promoter elements ( NF - AT binding sites ) .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O B O O O B I I I I I I I O B I I I I O O

"Their IL - 2 transcription seems to be controlled solely by the transition from inactive to active functional state of a positive transcription factor binding to these promoter elements as well as its cytoplasmic or nuclear location : in resting memory T cells the activator is located in the cytoplasm and is inactive , whereas in stimulated cells it is functional in promoting transcription and now resides in the nucleus .",O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Defective translocation of protein kinase C in multidrug - resistant HL - 60 cells confers a reversible loss of phorbol ester - induced monocytic differentiation .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previous studies have demonstrated that human HL - 60 myeloid leukemia cells differentiate in response to phorbol esters .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"When ligated to the murine c - fos promoter , however , the proIL - 1 beta enhancer was inducible in phorbol myristate acetate - stimulated HeLa cells , suggesting the existence of a proIL - 1 beta promoter - proximal requirement for tissue specificity .",O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
Lymphocytes from the site of disease suggest adenovirus is one cause of persistent or recurrent inflammatory arthritis .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five patients were found with repeated maximal responses to adenovirus antigen ; in one of these adenovirus nucleotide sequences were present in a synovial biopsy specimen .,O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O

"We have identified a putative transcription factor , designated PILOT , with an identical dual signal requirement for expression .",O O O O O B I O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Induction of the PILOT gene is detectable in human T cells 20 min following activation in the presence of cycloheximide and is fully suppressed by CyA .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This observation directly demonstrates the existence of a Ca2 + signal - dependent regulatory element obligatory for expression of some genes in T cells but not in fibroblasts .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O

Antisense oligonucleotides to the p65 subunit of NF - kappa B block CD11b expression and alter adhesion properties of differentiated HL - 60 granulocytes .,O O O O B I O B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This function has been attributed to the coordinated binding of subunits of NF - kappa B to distinct regions of the promoter elements of numerous genes , including cytokines , growth factor receptors , and adhesion molecules .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I O O O O O B O B I I O O B I O
Antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF - kappa B complex were used to define the physiologic role of this transcription factor in resting and stimulated granulocytes .,O O O O O B O B I O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
A reduction in the expression of p65 was produced by treatment with the phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
This reduction was accompanied by rapid changes in the cellular adhesion of dimethyl sulfoxide - differentiated HL - 60 leukemia cells stimulated by 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol 13 - acetate ( TPA ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These effects were characterized by a marked reduction in CD11b integrin expression on the surface of treated cells .,O O O O O O O O O B B O O O O O O O O

The p65 subunit of NF - kappa B regulates I kappa B by two distinct mechanisms .,O B I O B I I I O B I I O O O O O
Transcription factor NF - kappa B ( p50 / p65 ) is generally localized to the cytoplasm by its inhibitor I kappa B .,O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
"Overproduced I kappa B , free from NF - kappa B , is rapidly degraded .",O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O
"In contrast , p65 delta , a naturally occurring splice variant , fails to markedly augment I kappa B protein levels .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
"Both overexpressed p65 and coexpressed p50 are cytoplasmic , whereas p65 delta is partly nuclear , indicating that the I kappa B induced by p65 can maintain NF - kappa B in the cytoplasm .",O O B O O B O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I O O B O O B I I I O O O O
"Thus , p65 and I kappa B are linked in an autoregulatory loop , ensuring that NF - kappa B is held in the cytoplasm until cells are specifically induced to translocate it to the nucleus .",O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lipopolysaccharide induces phosphorylation of MAD3 and activation of c - Rel and related NF - kappa B proteins in human monocytic THP - 1 cells .,O O O O B O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
"Many effects of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) on gene expression , including that of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , in monocytic cells are mediated by activation of kappa B DNA - binding proteins .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"However , the specific members of the NF - kappa B / Rel transcription factor family involved in the LPS response , and the mechanisms through which LPS - generated signals are transduced remain unclear .",O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we show that LPS induces nuclear expression of c - Rel / p50 heterodimers as well as p50 / p65 ( NF - kappa B ) kappa B DNA - binding complexes in human monocytic THP - 1 cells .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nuclear localization of these proteins occurred concomitantly with a rapid decrease in their cytosolic levels and was independent of phorbol ester - sensitive protein kinase C .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"Within 24 h following LPS stimulation there was a striking increase in the levels of c - Rel , p105 , and p50 in the cytosol .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O B O O O O
The increased levels of these proteins correlated with increases in the amounts of their mRNAs during LPS activation of THP - 1 cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
"LPS activation of THP - 1 cells resulted in phosphorylation of MAD3 ( an I kappa B - like protein ) , a rapid increase in MAD3 mRNA , and an increase in MAD3 protein by 2 h .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O
"Thus , LPS activation of human monocytic cells results in nuclear expression of c - Rel / p50 and p50 / p65 ( NF - kappa B ) and induces phosphorylation of MAD3 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O B I I I O O O O O B O
A chimeric type II / type I interleukin - 1 receptor can mediate interleukin - 1 induction of gene expression in T cells .,O B I I I I I I I I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O
The type I interleukin - 1 receptor ( IL - 1R ) is capable of transducing a signal resulting in promoter activation in T cells .,O B I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This signal transduction is dependent on the cytoplasmic domain , which consists of 213 amino acids .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
"In contrast to the type I receptor , the type II IL - 1R has a small cytoplasmic tail , and it is not clear whether this receptor is a signal - transducing or a regulatory molecule .",O O O O B I I O O B I I I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I O
Here we report that the type II IL - 1R does not mediate gene activation in Jurkat cells .,O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O
"However , a hybrid receptor composed of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the human type II interleukin - 1 fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the human type I IL - 1R was capable of transducing a signal across the membrane resulting in a pattern of gene activation identical to that mediated by the type I IL - 1R .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I I O O O B I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
Our results indicated that the extracellular domain of the type II IL - 1R was capable of functionally interacting with interleukin - 1 and transmitting the resulting signal to a heterologous cytoplasmic domain .,O O O O O B I O O B I I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O
A mutation of the glucocorticoid receptor in primary cortisol resistance .,O O O O B I O O O O O
In a subject with primary cortisol resistance we have observed glucocorticoid receptors ( hGR ) with a decreased affinity for dexamethasone .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O
We hypothesize that a mutation of the hGR glucocorticoid - binding domain is the cause of cortisol resistance .,O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O
"Total RNA isolated from the index subject ' s mononuclear leukocytes was used to produce first strand hGR cDNAs , and the entire hGR cDNA was amplified in segments and sequenced .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O O O
"When the wild - type hGR and hGR - Ile 729 were expressed in CV - 1 cells that were cotransfected with the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) gene , the hGR - Ile 729 conferred a fourfold decrease in apparent potency on dexamethasone stimulation of CAT activity .",O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I I I I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The isoleucine for valine substitution at amino acid 729 impairs the function of the hGR and is the likely cause of primary cortisol resistance in this subject .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The transcriptionally active factors mediating the effect of the HTLV - I Tax transactivator on the IL - 2R alpha kappa B enhancer include the product of the c - rel proto - oncogene .,O B I I O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I I I I I O O O O O B I I I I I O
The transactivator HTLV - I Tax activates the promoter of the gene coding for the interleukin 2 alpha - chain receptor ( IL - 2R alpha ) via a kappa B site that can bind several protein species of the rel family .,O O B I I I O O B O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I O
"Tax1 strongly activates the enhancer activity of this motif , in both epithelial HeLa and lymphoid Jurkat cells .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This activation was not observed in undifferentiated embryocarcinoma F9 cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O
"Overexpression of the p50 , p65 and Rel proteins in these cells showed that significant activation of the IL - 2R alpha kappa B site was observed only with Rel and Rel plus p65 .",O O O B O B O B I O O O O O O O O O B I I I B I I O O O O B O B O B O
"Moreover , whereas both Tax and phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) are able to efficiently induce the binding of NF - kappa B to the IL - 2R alpha kappa B site , PMA is functionally inactive .",O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O
"Using the DNA affinity precipitation assay , we observed that Tax1 is able to efficiently induce the binding of Rel , whereas PMA is not .",O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This established a clear difference between both stimuli , indicating that Rel is the functionally active factor .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I O
We conclude from these results that the functional activity of members of the rel family is regulated by their interaction with DNA and that Rel can be a potent transcriptional activator on specific kappa B sites .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O
Role of AP - 1 - and octamer - binding proteins in control of IL3 gene expression .,O O B I I I I I I I I O O O B O O O

"Using transfection and reporter gene assays specifically designed for primary T lymphocytes in conjunction with gel retardation assays , Western blot analyses and UV cross - linking studies , we found that c - Jun , c - Fos , and octamer - binding proteins play a major role in transcriptional activation of the IL3 gene via their interaction with two specific regions contained within the IL3 5 ' - flanking sequence .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
"Additionally , the region between bases - 107 and - 59 of the IL3 promoter containing putative AP - 2 and Sp1 binding motifs appears necessary for basal level expression of the IL3 gene .",O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O B O O
The data also indicate that CD2 receptor activation and phytohemagglutinin plus phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate stimulation augment T cell IL3 gene expression through the same cis - and trans - activating signals .,O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results should contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of IL3 gene expression in human T lymphocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O
"Inducible expression of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is regulated by a cellular transcription factor , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I O B I I I O O
"NF - kappa B is composed of distinct subunits ; five independent genes , NFKB1 ( p105 ) , NFKB2 ( p100 ) , RelA ( p65 ) , c - rel and relB , that encode related proteins that bind to kappa B DNA elements have been isolated .",B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O B O B O O B I I I O B I I O B O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O

p49 has a approximately 18 - fold - lower affinity for the HIV kappa B site ( KD = 69 . 1 pM ) than does the approximately 50 - kDa protein NFKB1 ( p50 ) derived from p105 ( KD = 3 . 9 pM ) .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B O O O O O O O O O

( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ),O O O O O O O
The long terminal repeat ( LTR ) of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) and the 5 ' regulatory region of the gene encoding the interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit ( IL - 2R alpha ) share functional kappa B enhancer elements involved in the regulation of these inducible transcription units during T - cell activation .,O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O B I I I I O B I I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These kappa B enhancer elements are recognized by a structurally related family of interactive proteins that includes p50 , p65 , and the product of the c - rel protooncogene ( c - Rel ) .",O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O
"Recent biochemical studies have shown that p65 and p50 form the prototypical NF - kappa B complex , which is rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during T - cell activation .",O O O O O O B O B O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"These inhibitory effects of c - Rel correlate with its DNA - binding activity but not with its ability to heterodimerize with p50 , suggesting that c - Rel inhibition involves competition with p50 / p65 for occupancy of the kappa B enhancer element .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
"Together , these findings suggest that one function of c - Rel is as a physiologic repressor of the HIV - 1 LTR and IL - 2R alpha promoters , serving to efficiently counter the strong transcriptional activating effects of p65 .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Ras oncogene transformation of human B lymphoblasts is associated with lymphocyte activation and with a block of differentiation .,B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The p21ras small GTP binding proteins participate in signal transduction from cell surface receptors and affect neoplastic transformation and development in many different cell types .,O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In the present study , we examined the relationship between ras transformation and differentiation of human B lymphocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We show that the constitutive expression of the T24 Ha - ras oncogene in EBV - immortalized B lymphoblasts was associated with the induction of the interleukin 2 receptor alpha subunit , with an impaired immunoglobulin gene expression , altered adhesion properties and increased survival in serum - free medium .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Comparative analysis of NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T cells ) complex in human T and B lymphocytes .,O O O B O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O
Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) is a transcriptional activator that binds to sequences in the interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) promoter and is thought to be largely responsible for the T cell - specific inducibility of IL - 2 expression .,O O O O O O O B O O O B I O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSA ) showed that specific NFAT binding activity could also be induced in human B cells .,O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
"The B cell NFAT complex , however , was not functional , since it failed to activate transcription from an NFAT - driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) construct .",O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O
Purified recombinant Jun and Fos proteins failed to bind directly to the NFAT motif .,O O B I I I O O O O O O B I O

"We therefore propose a model whereby a core NFAT complex consisting of Jun , Fos , and a constitutive nuclear factor is formed in both T and B cells , but an additional factor and / or post - translational modification of a factor , missing in B cells , might be required for transactivation by NFAT .",O O O O O O O O B I O O B O B O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Regulation of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) expression by its cognate ligand was examined in the glucocorticoid - sensitive human leukemic T - cell line 6TG1 . 1 and in the human B - cell line IM - 9 .,O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Half - maximal induction of GR mRNA and protein in 6TG1 . 1 cells was observed between 10 - 100 nM dexamethasone , and inclusion of 1 microM RU 38486 completely blocked the effects of 100 nM dexamethasone , demonstrating that positive autoregulation of GR expression in 6TG1 . 1 cells is a receptor - mediated response .",O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Thus , positive autoregulation is neither a consequence nor the sole cause of growth arrest .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The degree of negative autoregulation in IM - 9 cells and positive autoregulation in 6TG1 . 1 cells was unaffected by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A similar half - life was determined in IM - 9 cells and was also unaffected by steroid treatment .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The Sp1 transcription factor binds the CD11b promoter specifically in myeloid cells in vivo and is essential for myeloid - specific promoter activity .,O B I I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
Lineage - specific expression is controlled at the level of mRNA transcription .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To characterize regulatory sequences important for promoter activity , we performed linker scanning analysis of the 92 - bp CD11b promoter and demonstrate that a sequence at bp - 60 is essential for CD11b promoter activity .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
We show that this sequence binds the transcription factor Sp1 in vitro and in vivo .,O O O O O O O B I B O O O O O O
"In vivo the Sp1 site is bound only in myeloid ( U937 ) cells , not in cervical carcinoma ( HeLa ) cells .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , the macrophage transcription factor PU . 1 binds the CD11b promoter in vitro and in vivo close to the Sp1 site .",O O O O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I O
We propose a model in which binding of a myeloid - specific factor ( PU . 1 ) allows a general factor ( Sp1 ) to bind in a tissue - specific fashion thereby contributing to the myeloid - specific expression of CD11b .,O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In addition , some IDDM sera that contain antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase also coprecipitate a 38 , 000 - M ( r ) protein from islets .",O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O
"This study used a high titer anti - 38 , 000 - M ( r ) serum to screen bacteriophage lambda cDNA expression libraries and identified human islet and placental clones encoding jun - B , the nuclear transcription protein , of predicted 38 , 000 M ( r ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Peripheral blood T - cells exhibited significant proliferation in response to a recombinant fragment of jun - B ( amino acids 1 - 180 ) in 12 of 17 ( 71 % ) recent - onset IDDM subjects , 8 of 16 ( 50 % ) ICA - positive first - degree relatives of IDDM subjects who were at risk , 3 of 12 ( 25 % ) other autoimmune disease subjects , and 0 of 10 healthy control subjects .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Stimulation of interleukin - 1 alpha and interleukin - 1 beta production in human monocytes by protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors .,O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are important in regulating cellular functions by controlling the phosphorylation state of their substrates .,B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In human monocytes , the inhibitors of these phosphatases , okadaic acid and calyculin A , were found to increase the mRNA accumulation and cytokine production of interleukin - 1 beta and interleukin - 1 alpha .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O
The increased mRNA accumulation was found to be primarily because of the increase in the transcription rate of the interleukin - 1 genes .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Stimulation of interleukin - 1 gene transcription may be caused by the stimulation of transcription factor activities , including those of AP - 1 , by these protein phosphatase inhibitors .",O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I O O O B I O O
This increased processing and secretion correlated with the stimulation of IL - 1 beta convertase mRNA accumulation .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O
The stimulation of interleukin - 1 alpha production by okadaic acid was more modest than that of interleukin - 1 beta .,O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"However , the phosphorylation of the precursor interleukin - 1 alpha cytokine was increased .",O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O
These results show that protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitors exert multiple effects on cytokine production in human monocytes and suggest that these two phosphatases play important roles in regulating interleukin - 1 production .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I O O

CD28 is a T - cell surface molecule and stimulation through this protein plays an important role in delivering the second activation signal .,B O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Tal - 1 gene encodes a putative transcription factor with a basic helix - loop - helix domain and is known to be predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells .,B I I I O O O B I O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the pattern of tal - 1 expression in purified human hematopoietic cells by in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
Both methods demonstrated that the tal - 1 gene is expressed in megakaryocytes and erythroblasts as well as in basophilic granulocytes .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Exposure to VitD3 rapidly induced the de novo expression of CD14 mRNA and protein .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
"The addition of cycloheximide completely blocked the VitD3 induction of CD14 mRNA expression , indicating that the induction was dependent on ongoing protein synthesis .",O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Interaction between protein kinase C ( PKC ) - and glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) - mediated signaling is suggested by the ability of the PKC activating phorbol ester 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) to inhibit GR - dependent transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus ( MMTV ) long terminal repeat ( LTR ) .,O O B I I O B O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O
TPA - GR synergism was determined to have occurred at the GR - responsive element ( GRE ) level by functional analysis of deletion mutants or synthetic GRE oligonucleotides driving chloramphenicol acetyl - transferase expression .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B O O O O O O B I O B I I O B I I I O O
"Synergism required an intact GR DNA - binding domain , whereas amino - or carboxyl - terminal domains were dispensable .",O O O O B I I I I O O B I I I I I I O O O

"Conversely , c - jun and jun - B transfection blunted GR - dependent transcription in HeLa cells .",O O B I I O B I I O O B O O O O O O O
"The presence of c - fos had a negative influence on GR function and correlated with the cell - specific synergistic or antagonistic activity of Jun with respect to GR ; high basal expression of c - fos as well as AP - 1 DNA binding and transcriptional activity were observed in HeLa cells , but not in T cells .",O O O B I I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This sequence element was referred to as the BAT box and its deletion significantly reduced the activity of a CD20 promoter - CAT construct in B cells .,O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mobility shift assays with various mutant probes and B cell nuclear extracts demonstrated that the core sequence TAAT was essential for binding to this site .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Southwestern blotting and UV cross - linking studies confirmed that the BAT box binding proteins were Oct - 1 and Oct - 2 .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I O B I I O
The affinity of the BAT box binding proteins for the BAT box was approximately 25 - fold less than for the octamer sequence and the BAT box binding proteins dissociated from the BAT box 10 - fold more rapidly than from the octamer sequence .,O O O O B I I I O O B I O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I O

The autologous DE LCL containing a transduced pml / RAR alpha fusion gene and expressing a bcr1 type of the pml / RAR alpha hybrid protein induced the proliferation of DE anti - BCR1 / 25 T cell clones .,O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"It is concluded that the bcr1 type - pml / RAR alpha fusion protein of APL contains an antigenic site , absent from the normal parent molecules and recognized by human CD4 + lymphocytes .",O O O O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The Epstein - Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 interacts with an EBNA2 responsive cis - element of the terminal protein 1 gene promoter .,O B I I I I I I O O O B I I I I O O B I I I I O
The Epstein - Barr virus protein EBNA2 acts as a transcriptional activator of cellular and viral genes and plays a crucial role in the immortalization of human primary B - cells by EBV .,O B I I I I I O O O B I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We have shown previously that EBNA2 transactivates the promoters of the latent membrane antigens LMP , TP1 and TP2 .",O O O O O B O O O O O B I I B O B O B O
The promoter of the TP1 gene was chosen as a model system to study the molecular mechanism of EBNA2 mediated transactivation .,O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
"To identify an EBNA2 dependent cis - acting element , various TP1 promoter - reporter gene constructs were transfected in the absence and presence of an EBNA2 expression vector into the established B - cell line BL41 - P3HR1 .",O O O B I I I I I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
We were able to delineate an 81 bp EBNA2 responsive region between - 258 and - 177 relative to the TP1 RNA start site .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O

Minimally modified low density lipoprotein - induced inflammatory responses in endothelial cells are mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate .,O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We have previously shown that minimally oxidized LDL ( MM - LDL ) activated endothelial cells to increase their interaction with monocytes but not neutrophils , inducing monocyte but not neutrophil binding and synthesis of monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 and monocyte colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I I I O B I I O O
In the present studies we have examined the signaling pathways by which this monocyte - specific response is induced .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both induction of monocyte binding and mRNA levels for M - CSF by MM - LDL were not inhibited in protein kinase C - depleted endothelial cells .,O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
A number of our studies indicate that cAMP is the second messenger for the effects of MM - LDL cited above .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O
Incubation of endothelial cells with MM - LDL caused a 173 % increase in intracellular cAMP levels .,O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Agents which elevated cAMP were also shown to activate NF kappa B , suggesting a role for this transcription factor in activation of monocyte - endothelial interactions .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cell - specific expression of helix - loop - helix transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene .,O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I O
The E2A gene encodes transcription factors of the helix - loop - helix family that are implicated in cell - specific gene expression as part of dimeric complexes that interact with E box enhancer elements .,O B I O B I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I I O
It has previously been shown that transcripts of the E2A gene can be detected in a wide range of cell types .,O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O

"Our results are consistent with the view that the DNA - binding activity LEF1 / BCF1 is a homodimer of E2A proteins ; the selective appearance of this putative cell - specific transcription factor in B lymphoid cells seems to be attributable , at least in part , to the elevated E2A protein concentrations in these cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O

The MR - count was significantly decreased in the PIH - group .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The values of plasma aldosterone and 18 - OH - B were also low .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results can not be explained by receptor down - regulation due to higher level of mineralocorticoids of the zona glomerulosa .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

TPA induction increases the binding of ubiquitous AP - 1 factors to this element .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O
TPA induction inhibits the binding of the lineage limited transcription factor NF - E2 to this transcriptional control element .,O O O O O O O B I I I B I I O O B I I O
Hemin induction of K562 cells does not facilitate the binding of NF - E2 to its recognition site .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O

"Over its 3 ' end , it binds a factor that is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed .",O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"This factor is Oct - 1 or an immunologically related octamer - binding protein , and it plays a role in coordinating the activity of several regulatory elements .",O O O B I I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
These characteristics make the ACT - 1 site analogous to the activating ARRE - 1 site in the IL - 2 promoter .,O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O
"Furthermore , and despite a lack of sequence homology , the promoters of IL - 3 and IL - 2 share an organizational pattern of regulatory elements that is likely to be important for the T - cell - specific expression of these genes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Redox status of cells influences constitutive or induced NF - kappa B translocation and HIV long terminal repeat activity in human T and monocytic cell lines .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O

Enhanced NF - kappa B binding activity is followed by functional activation in that inducibility of the IL - 2 receptor alpha chain is mediated by enhanced NF - kappa B binding and that a heterologous promoter containing the NF - kappa B consensus sequence ( - 291 to - 245 ) of the IL - 2 receptor alpha chain gene is activated .,O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I I I I O O O B I I I I I I O O O

Regulation of c - jun expression during induction of monocytic differentiation by okadaic acid .,O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
The results demonstrate that okadaic acid treatment is associated with induction of a differentiated monocyte phenotype characterized by : ( a ) growth arrest ; ( b ) increases in Mac - 1 cell surface antigen expression ; ( c ) down - regulation of c - myc transcripts ; and ( d ) induction of tumor necrosis factor gene expression .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O

"The binding of NF ( P ) ( a DNA binding protein that specifically recognizes the P sequence ) to the P sequence was abolished when oligonucleotides carrying base substitutions were used , indicating that the NF ( P ) interaction is sequence - specific and that binding specificity of the protein paralleled the sequence requirements for IL - 4 expression in vivo .",O O O B I I I O O B I I O O O O B I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O

During the inflammatory response increased levels of PGE2 bind to their receptors on T cells and thus alter responsiveness .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Proliferation of T cells was induced by immobilized anti - CD3 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) in the presence or absence of an additional costimulatory signal delivered by anti - CD28 mAb .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O

The results demonstrate that physiologic concentrations of all three of these agents inhibit the anti - CD3 mAb - induced proliferation of T cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O

"Class II antigen expressing T - cell lines maintained contacts identical to B - cell lines , while class II - negative T - cell lines exhibited no interactions .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In lymphoid cell lines , the octamer site is occupied and required for maximal expression .",O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
This is most likely due to the presence of the lymphoid - specific OTF - 2 factor .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"In contrast , the class II - positive nonlymphoid glioblastoma cell line does not exhibit interactions at the octamer site despite the presence of the ubiquitous OTF - 1 factor and an open binding site .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I O
"Thus , the DRA promoter discriminates against OTF - 1 activation at the level of DNA binding in the glioblastoma line .",O O O B I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Furthermore , as a consequence of the increased HB24 mRNA levels , the Jurkat HB24 transfectants proliferated more rapidly than control cell lines .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thus , stable expression of HB24 confers an activation phenotype on a human T cell line , implicating this gene as an important transcriptional factor during T cell activation and growth .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
Functional interaction between the two zinc finger domains of the v - erb A oncoprotein .,O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I O
The v - erb A oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus is a mutated and virally transduced copy of a host cell gene encoding a thyroid hormone receptor .,O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O
The protein expressed by the v - erb A oncogene binds to DNA and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of both the thyroid hormone receptor and the closely related retinoic acid receptor .,O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O
"The v - erb A protein has sustained two amino acid alterations within its DNA - binding domain relative to that of c - erb A , one of which , at serine 61 , is known to be important for v - erb A function in the neoplastic cell .",O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O
"We report here that the second alteration , at threonine 78 , also plays an important , although more indirect , role : alteration of the sequence at threonine 78 such that it resembles that of c - erb A can act as an intragenic suppressor and can partially restore function to a v - erb A protein rendered defective due to a mutation at position 61 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I O
"Threonine 78 lies within the D - box of the v - erb A protein , a region thought to mediate receptor - receptor dimerizations , and is not in physical proximity to the serine at position 61 .",O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
It therefore appears that an indirect interaction occurs between these two sites and that this interaction is crucial for v - erb A function .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
"cis - acting sequences required for inducible interleukin - 2 enhancer function bind a novel Ets - related protein , Elf - 1 .",B I I I O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I O B I I O
The recent definition of a consensus DNA binding sequence for the Ets family of transcription factors has allowed the identification of potential Ets binding sites in the promoters and enhancers of many inducible T - cell genes .,O O O O O O B I I O O B I O B I O O O O O O B I I O O B O B O O B I I I I O
"Within the human enhancer , these two sites are located within the previously defined DNase I footprints , NFAT - 1 and NFIL - 2B , respectively .",O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I O B I I O O O

"Elf - 1 contains a DNA binding domain that is nearly identical to that of E74 , the ecdysone - inducible Drosophila transcription factor required for metamorphosis ( hence the name Elf - 1 , for E74 - like factor 1 ) .",B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I O O
Elf - 1 bound specifically to both EBS1 and EBS2 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays .,B I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O

Transcription of the hypersensitive site HS2 enhancer in erythroid cells .,O O O B I I I O O O O

The mechanism of HS2 enhancer function is not known .,O O O B I O O O O O
The present study employs RNA protection assays to analyze the transcriptional status of the HS2 enhancer in transfected recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) plasmids .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I I I I I O
"In erythroid K562 cells in which the HS2 enhancer is active , the HS2 sequence directs the synthesis of long enhancer transcripts that are initiated apparently from within the enhancer and elongated through the intervening DNA into the cis - linked CAT gene .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I I I O

TAR - independent transactivation by Tat in cells derived from the CNS : a novel mechanism of HIV - 1 gene regulation .,B O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) is essential for productive infection and is a potential target for antiviral therapy .,O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Tat , a potent activator of HIV - 1 gene expression , serves to greatly increase the rate of transcription directed by the viral promoter .",B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"This induction , which seems to be an important component in the progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , may be due to increased transcriptional initiation , increased transcriptional elongation , or a combination of these processes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Much attention has been focused on the interaction of Tat with a specific RNA target termed TAR ( transactivation responsive ) which is present in the leader sequence of all HIV - 1 mRNAs .,O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O

Transcription factor AP - 2 activates gene expression of HTLV - I .,B I I I I O O O O O O O O
The HTLV - I LTR contains three conserved regulatory elements known as 21 base pair repeats which are required for stimulation of gene expression by the transactivator protein tax .,O B I I I O O O B I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I B O
"Mutagenesis indicates that the 21 bp repeats can be subdivided into three motifs , A , B and C , each of which influences the level of tax activation .",O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The A site in the 21 bp repeat has strong homology with previously described binding sites for the transcription factor AP - 2 .,O B I O O B I I O O O O O O B I O O B I I I I O
We demonstrated that AP - 2 mRNA was present in T - lymphocytes and that cellular factors from both non - transformed and transformed T - lymphocytes specifically bound to the consensus motif for AP - 2 in each 21 bp .,O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O
"To determine the role of AP - 2 in the regulation of the HTLV - I LTR gene expression , we used an AP - 2 cDNA in DNA binding and transient expression assays .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O

The function of a putative NFAT - 1 site in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer has been analyzed .,O O O O B I I I I O O B I I I I I O O O O
"The putative NFAT - 1 region is not required for the response to anti - CD3 or to mitogens in T - cell , B - cell , or monocyte / macrophage leukemia lines , nor is it a cis - acting negative regulatory element .",O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
"The B cell - specific nuclear factor OTF - 2 positively regulates transcription of the human class II transplantation gene , DRA .",O B I I I I I B I I O O O O O B I I I I O B O
Several DNA - binding proteins are known to bind this sequence .,O B I I I O O O O O O O
The best characterized are the B cell - specific OTF - 2 and the ubiquitous OTF - 1 .,O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I I O
This report directly demonstrates that OTF - 2 but not OTF - 1 regulates the DRA gene .,O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O B I O
"In contrast , OTF - 1 - enriched protein fractions did not affect DRA gene transcription although it functionally enhanced the transcription of another gene .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
"In vivo transient transfection studies utilizing an OTF - 2 expression vector resulted in similar findings : that OTF - 2 protein enhanced DRA gene transcription , and that this effect requires an intact octamer element .",O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B I I I O B I O O O O O O O O O B I O
Together these results constitute the first direct evidence of a positive role for the lymphoid - specific octamer - binding factor in DRA gene transcription .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O
Interferon - gamma potentiates the antiviral activity and the expression of interferon - stimulated genes induced by interferon - alpha in U937 cells .,B I I O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O

We have found that ISG expression in the monocytic U937 cell line differs from most cell lines previously examined .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"U937 cells express both type I and type II IFN receptors , but only IFN - alpha is capable of inducing antiviral protection in these cells .",O O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
"Pretreatment with IFN - gamma potentiates the IFN - alpha - induced protection , but IFN - gamma alone does not have any antiviral activity .",O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
"ISG15 mRNA accumulation in U937 cells is not detectable before 6 h of IFN - alpha treatment , peaks at 24 h , and requires protein synthesis .",B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Although IFN - gamma alone does not induce ISG expression , IFN - gamma pretreatment markedly increases and hastens ISG expression and transcriptional induction .",O B I I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Nuclear extracts assayed for the presence of ISRE binding factors by electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that ISGF3 is induced by IFN - alpha within 6 h from undetectable basal levels in untreated U937 cells .,O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O

Single point estimation of glucocorticoid receptors in lymphocytes of normal subjects and of children under long term glucocorticoid treatment .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A single point assay of glucocorticoid receptors ( GR ) in human lymphocytes based on the measurement of specific dexamethasone binding has been developed and compared with a common multi - point Scatchard analysis .,O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The assay conditions - concentration of the ligand 20 nmol / l , incubation time 2 h and the cell count 2 - 6 mil .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cells / tube in the assay volume 0 . 25 ml were found to be optimal .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Though specifically bound dexamethasone measured by whole - cell assay and that using cell harvester correlated well , almost by one order lower values obtained with the latter method render it non - applicable for receptor quantitation .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results from 9 healthy volunteers ( average GR concentration 7131 + / - 1256 sites / cell ) correlated excellently with those obtained by the Scatchard analysis .,O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The single point assay has been also applied for determination of GH in 10 children treated with large doses of prednisone .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The average values from healthy volunteers did not differ significantly from those found in these children , though much broader range was found in patients .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"In parallel , the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on 3 - O - methyl - D - glucose uptake was assayed in the corresponding mononuclear leukocytes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The glucocorticoid receptor levels in mononuclear leukocytes correlated with those in polymorphonuclear leukocytes , and there was a linear relationship between the cellular glucocorticoid receptor levels and glucocorticoid - mediated inhibition of the uptake of 3 - O - methyl - D - glucose in mononuclear leukocytes .",O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Transcription factor activation and functional stimulation of human monocytes .,B I O O O O O O O O
Activation of expression of genes encoding transcription factors : c - fos and c - jun and formation of AP1 transcriptional complex in human monocytes was investigated .,O O O O B O B I O B I I O B I I O O O B I I O O O O O O

Tumor necrosis factor induced slightly c - fos and had almost no effect on c - jun and AP1 .,B I I O O B I I O O O O O O B I I O B O
The data suggest that differences in functional responses elicited in monocytes by all three factors may be dependent on different routes on nuclear signalling employed by the factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Glucocorticoids are known to downregulate interleukin - 1 beta production in monocytic cells by two different mechanims : direct inhibition of the gene transcription and destabilization of the preformed interleukin - 1 beta mRNA .,O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
Now we have examined the effect of the nature of the monocyte activating signal on these two inhibitory mechanims .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"When human monocytes were preincubated with dexamethasone for 1 hour and then stimulated either with bacterial lipopolysaccharide or phorbol myristate , it was found that dexamethasone inhibited the lipopolysaccharide - induced interleukin - 1 beta protein production , but the phorbol myristate - induced production was increased 3 - 10 fold .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This difference was also seen at the mRNA level .,O O O O O O O O O O
"When dexamethasone was added to the cultures 3 hours after the stimulators , it clearly decreased the interleukin - 1 beta mRNA levels regardless of the stimulator used ( although the effect was clearly weaker on the PMA - induced mRNA ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
Thus these data suggest that the phorbol myristate - induced signal ( prolonged protein kinase C activation ? ) can not be inhibited by prior incubation with dexamethasone and it also protects the induced mRNA for the degradative action of dexamethasone .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O

The latter ` ` nuclear factor for activated T cells ` ` likely contributes to the tissue specificity of IL - 2 gene expression .,O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O

All factors are induced in the nuclei of T cells upon activation with mitogens but not with exogenous IL - 2 growth factor .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I I I I O

"For apoplexic patients with lesions localized to the base of the brain as indicated by computerized tomography , the diurnal variation of GR was abolished .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
"Conversely , diurnal rhythmicity persisted in apoplexy patients whose lesions were in the cerebral cortex .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"To study the transcription factor requirement in B - cells , different U2 enhancer constructions were transfected into the lymphoid cell line , BJA - B .",O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results showed that the activation of U2 snRNA transcription in B - cells also requires an enhancer comprising both the Oct and at least one Sp 1 - binding site .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I I O
"Deletion of all the Sp 1 - binding sites from the enhancer reduces transcription by 80 - 90 % in HeLa , as well as in BJA - B cells , whereas the removal of the octamer - binding site reduces transcription to levels below detection in both cell types .",O O O O B I I I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O

"The results also revealed a similar functional cooperation between the transcription factors which bind to the Oct and the adjacent Sp 1 - binding site in BJA - B cells , as has been observed in HeLa cells , since a template which contains a weak binding site for OTFs expresses wild - type levels of U2 snRNA in both cell types when the weak octamer - binding site is combined with a Sp 1 - binding site .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I I I O

This absence of binding was localized to the NF - kappa B region of the HIV - 1 enhancer ; the 65 - kDa plus 50 - kDa NF - kappa B heterodimer was preferentially lost .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I I O O B I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O
Adding purified NF - kappa B protein to nuclear extracts from cells with restricted expression overcomes this lack of binding .,O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Synergism between two distinct elements of the HTLV - I enhancer during activation by the trans - activator of HTLV - I .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B I I O O O O O
"We have conducted functional studies of the enhancer elements of human T - cell leukemia virus type I ( HTLV - I ) using the human T - cell lines Jurkat and MOLT 4 , which are negative for HTLV - I , and MT - 2 and TL - Mor , which carry the proviral genome of HTLV - I .",O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two distinct elements have been implicated in function of the HTLV - I enhancer .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
One is the 21 - base - pair ( bp ) core element that is responsible for trans - activation by the HTLV - I trans - activator p40tax and that has the ability to bind to cyclic - AMP responsive element binding factor ( CREB ) - like factor ( s ) .,O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O O O O
The other is a region interposed between the 21 - bp elements .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"In this study we demonstrate that a subfragment ( C26 ) in the region between the 21 - bp elements is involved in trans - activation by p40tax , possibly through binding to an NF - kappa B - like nuclear factor or factors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O
"The C26 element conferred partial responsiveness to p40tax when linked to one copy of the 21 - bp element that , by itself , showed little activation in response to p40tax .",O B I O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O
"However , the C26 element alone , even when repeated , could not be activated by p40tax , unlike other NF - kappa B - binding elements .",O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I I I I I O

"Although three sites in the TNF - alpha promoter ( kappa 1 , kappa 2 , and kappa 3 ) specifically bind the transcription factor NF - kappa B in lymphoid nuclear extracts , TNF - alpha mRNA induction by PMA does not correlate with NF - kappa B binding activities displayed by different T and B cell lines .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O

Lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptor number in posttraumatic stress disorder .,O B I O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : The authors ' objective was to investigate the possibility that glucocorticoid receptor changes may be involved in the dysregulation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis in posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHOD : They measured the number of lymphocyte cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors and plasma cortisol concentrations in 15 consecutively admitted male combat Vietnam veterans with PTSD and in a normal comparison group of 11 subjects .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"RESULTS : Both the patients and the normal comparison subjects showed a morning - to - afternoon decline in glucocorticoid receptor concentrations , paralleling the normal diurnal decline in cortisol levels .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
The number of glucocorticoid receptors was 63 % greater in the morning and 26 % greater in the afternoon in the patients with PTSD than in the normal subjects .,O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"No group differences in cortisol levels were observed , nor were glucocorticoid receptor number and cortisol levels correlated .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
The number of morning glucocorticoid receptors was positively correlated with symptoms of PTSD and anxiety .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS : These results provide further evidence for a dysregulation of the HPA axis in PTSD .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The finding that patients with PTSD had a substantially greater number of lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors than normal comparison subjects is consistent with the authors ' previous observations of low 24 - hour urinary cortisol excretion in subjects with PTSD .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , the receptor changes observed are opposite of those reported in major depressive disorder .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The present data , along with other findings of HPA abnormalities in PTSD , support the possibility of a greater negative feedback sensitivity at one or more levels of the HPA axis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cells of the monocyte - macrophage lineage are important targets of HIV infection .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report here that the phenotypic differentiation of monocyte cell lines induced by phorbol esters or tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) is associated with expression of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF - kappa B ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O
"In parallel with such differentiation , HIV transcription , monitored using an HIV long terminal repeat reporter gene construct , is activated in such cells under the influence of enhanced NF - kappa B expression .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O
"Also , in a promonocyte cell line chronically infected with HIV , NF - kappa B expression and HIV transcription were enhanced on stimulation with phorbol ester or TNF alpha .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O

We describe a slide assay that allows the demonstration of antigens localized in the nucleus from isolated white blood cells as well as from single tumor cells derived from malignant effusions .,O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With the antibodies Ki - 67 and anti - p - 145 an increased rate of nuclear and nucleolar staining resulted in cells from highly malignant lymphomas .,O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An almost identical reaction was obtained when tumor cells from malignant effusions were tested .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cells isolated from the blood of patients with leukemic spread of lymphomas of low malignancy yielded a weak staining comparable to that of normal mesothelial cells from non - tumorous cavity fluids .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The detection of estrogen and progesterone receptors ( ER and PR ) localized in the cell nucleus can be achieved by the same assay .,O O O B O B I O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The reaction is enhanced by incubation of the tumor cells for 30 min at 37 degrees C prior to fixation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

These observations imply that TCF - 1 is involved in the control of several T cell - specific genes and might thus play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the mature T cell phenotype .,O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The regulatory effect of insulin on the specific binding power of glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) of human leukocytes was assessed by the unoccupied receptor sites capable of combining with [ 3H ] labelled dexamethasone measured at 3 and 24 h after incubation with various concentrations of insulin added to the medium .,O O O O B O O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"After 24 h incubation the decrease of these values increased respectively to 43 . 5 + / - 19 . 0 , 56 . 1 + / - 20 . 7 and 80 . 2 + / - 15 . 5 ( P less than 0 . 05 , P less than 0 . 01 and P less than 0 . 01 compared with control ) .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Thus the inhibitory effect of insulin on the GR binding power is both dose - and time - dependent , which strongly suggests that GR is tonically controlled by insulin concentration change under physiological conditions .",O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O

5 - Aminolevulinate synthase ( ALAS ) catalyzes the first step of the heme biosynthetic pathway .,B I I I O B O O O O O O O B O O O
cDNA clones for the human erythroid ALAS isozyme were isolated from a fetal liver library .,B I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
"It can be deduced that the erythroid ALAS precursor protein has a molecular weight of 64 . 6 kd , and is similar in size to the previously isolated human housekeeping ALAS precursor of molecular weight 70 . 6 kd .",O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O
"The mature mitochondrial forms of the erythroid and housekeeping ALAS isozymes are predicted to have molecular weights of 59 . 5 kd and 64 . 6 kd , respectively .",O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The two isozymes show little amino acid identity in their N - terminal signal sequences but have considerable sequence identity in the C - terminal two - thirds of their proteins .,O O B O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O
An analysis of the immediate promoter of the human erythroid ALAS gene revealed several putative erythroid - specific cis - acting elements including both a GATA - 1 and an NF - E2 binding site .,O O O O B I O O B I I I O O O B I I I I I I O O O B I I O O B I I I I O
"An iron - responsive element ( IRE ) motif has been identified in the 5 ' - untranslated region of the human erythroid ALAS mRNA , but is not present in the housekeeping ALAS mRNA .",O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I O
Gel retardation experiments established that this IRE motif formed a protein - RNA complex with cytosolic extracts from human K562 cells and this binding was strongly competed with IRE transcripts from ferritin or transferrin receptor mRNAs .,O O O O O O B I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I I I O

Kappa B - specific DNA binding proteins are differentially inhibited by enhancer mutations and biological oxidation .,B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
Kappa B ( kappa B ) enhancer binding proteins isolated from the nuclei of activated human T cells produce two distinct nucleoprotein complexes when incubated with the kappa B element from the interleukin - 2 receptor - alpha ( IL - 2R alpha ) gene .,B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I I I I I I O
"These two DNA - protein complexes are composed of at least four host proteins ( p50 , p55 , p75 , p85 ) , each of which shares structural similarity with the v - rel oncogene product .",O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B O B O B O B O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
Nuclear expression of these proteins is induced with distinctly biphasic kinetics following phorbol ester activation of T cells ( p55 / p75 early and p50 / p85 late ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O O
"DNA - protein crosslinking studies have revealed that the more rapidly migrating B2 complex contains both p50 and p55 while the more slowly migrating B1 complex is composed of p50 , p55 , p75 , and p85 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O B O O O O O B I O O O B O B O B O O B O
Site - directed mutagenesis of the wild - type IL - 2R alpha kappa B enhancer ( GGGGAATCTCCC ) has revealed that the binding of p50 and p55 ( B2 complex ) is particularly sensitive to alteration of the 5 ' triplet of deoxyguanosine residues .,O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
"In contrast , formation of the B1 complex , reflecting the binding of p75 and p85 , critically depends upon the more 3 ' sequences of this enhancer element .",O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"Similarly , covalent modification of free sulfhydryl groups with diamide ( reversible ) or N - ethylmaleimide ( irreversible ) results in a complete loss of DNA binding activity .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that reduced cysteine thiols play an important role in the DNA binding activity of this family of Rel - related transcription factors .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
The results were compared with those of 12 normal child - bearing - age women .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Evaluation of the role of ligand and thermal activation of specific DNA binding by in vitro synthesized human glucocorticoid receptor .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O
"We have used a DNA - binding / immunoprecipitation assay to analyze the capacity of human glucocorticoid receptor ( hGR ) , generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates , to bind DNA .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In vitro translated hGR was indistinguishable from native hGR , as determined by migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gels , sedimentation on sucrose density gradients , and reactivity with antipeptide antibodies generated against hGR .",B I I I O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O
"Using this assay system , we have evaluated the contributions of ligand binding and heat activation to DNA binding by these glucocorticoid receptors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
In vitro translated hGR was capable of selective DNA binding even in the absence of glucocorticoid .,B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment with dexamethasone or the antiglucocorticoid RU486 had no additional effect on the DNA - binding capacity when receptor preparations were maintained at 0 C ( no activation ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In contrast , addition of either ligand or antagonist in combination with a heat activation step promoted DNA binding by approximately 3 - fold over that of heat - activated unliganded receptors .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Agonist ( dexamethasone ) was slightly more effective in supporting specific DNA binding than antagonist ( RU486 ) .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The specificity of DNA binding by cell - free synthesized hGR was analyzed further by examining the abilities of various DNAs to compete for binding to a naturally occurring GRE found in the mouse mammary tumor virus - long terminal repeat .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I I I I I I O
"Together these studies indicate that hGR synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates displays many of the same properties , including GRE - specific DNA binding , observed for glucocorticoid receptor present in cytosolic extracts of mammalian cells and tissues .",O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Similarities between the effects of dexamethasone and RU486 suggest that the antiglucocorticoid properties of RU486 do not occur at the level of specific DNA binding .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"These findings support the conclusion that the interaction of 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 with its receptor on T - lymphocytes may play an important role in the regulation of granulomatous reactions , but because these receptors are expressed on different lymphocyte populations , the net effect of this potent immunoregulatory molecule is likely different in sarcoidosis and tuberculosis .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O

Here we report the cloning of murine TCF - 1 .,O O O O O O B I I I O
Murine and human TCF - 1 displayed a 95 . 5 % overall amino acid homology .,B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Recombinant murine and human TCF - 1 recognized the same sequence motif in the CD3 - epsilon enhancer as judged by gel retardation and methylation interference assays .,B I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O
With the murine cDNA clones several aspects of TCF - 1 were analyzed .,O O B I I O O O B I I O O O
"First , deletion analysis revealed that a region of TCF - 1 containing the HMG box was sufficient for sequence - specific binding .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I O O O O O O O O
"Second , by high stringency Northern blotting and in situ hybridization , TCF - 1 expression was shown to be confined to the thymus and to the T cell areas of the spleen .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The T lineage - specific expression and the affinity for functional motifs in the TCR - alpha and CD3 - epsilon enhancers imply an important role for TCF - 1 in the establishment of the mature T cell phenotype .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O
Cloning of a human homeobox gene that resembles a diverged Drosophila homeobox gene and is expressed in activated lymphocytes .,O O O B I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O
"A new homeobox gene , HB24 , has been isolated from a human B - lymphocyte cDNA library .",O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Two cDNA clones were sequenced and provided 2 , 250 nucleotides ( nt ) of DNA sequence information .",O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
"When the homeodomain from HB24 was compared to known mammalian and Drosophila homeodomains it was found to be only moderately conserved , but when it was compared to a highly diverged Drosophila homeodomain , H2 . 0 , it was found to be 80 % identical .",O O B O B O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The HB24 mRNA was absent or present at low levels in normal B and T lymphocytes ; however , with the appropriate activation signal HB24 mRNA was induced within several hours even in the presence of cycloheximide .",O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Positive hybridization was found in thymus , tonsil , bone marrow , developing vessels , and in fetal brain .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HB24 is likely to have an important role in lymphocytes as well as in certain developing tissues .,B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Platelet - activating factor is a potent mediator of the inflammatory response .,B I I I O O O O O O O O O
"Studies of the actions of platelet - activating factor have centered mainly around neutrophils , monocytes , and platelets .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
In this report we begin to uncover the influence of platelet - activating factor on B lymphocytes .,O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
"Employing the EBV - transformed human B cell line SKW6 . 4 , we demonstrate that platelet - activating factor significantly alters membrane phospholipid metabolism indicated by the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylinositol , and phosphatidic acid but not significantly into phosphatidylethanola at concentrations ranging from 10 ( - 9 ) to 10 ( - 6 ) M .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The inactive precursor , lyso - platelet - activating factor , at a concentration as high as 10 ( - 7 ) M had no effect on any of the membrane phospholipids .",O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We also show that platelet - activating factor from 10 ( - 12 ) to 10 ( - 6 ) M induced rapid and significant elevation in intracellular calcium levels , whereas lyso - platelet - activating factor was again ineffective .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
We further demonstrate the impact of platelet - activating factor binding to B cells by measuring platelet - activating factor induced arachidonic acid release and 5 - hydroxyeicosatetraen acid production .,O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"Moreover , platelet - activating factor was capable of inducing transcription of the nuclear proto - oncogenes c - fos and c - jun .",O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I B I I O B I I O
Finally we explored the possible role of 5 - hydroxyeicosatetraen acid as a regulator of arachidonic acid liberation demonstrating that endogenous 5 - lipoxygenase activity modulates platelet - activating factor induced arachidonic acid release perhaps acting at the level of phospholipase A2 .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"In summary , platelet - activating factor is shown here to have a direct and profound effect on a pure B cell line .",O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Positive and negative regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression by a novel B - cell - specific enhancer element .,O O O O O B I O O O O B I I I I I I O
A new B - cell - specific enhancer element has been identified 3 ' of E4 and the octamerlike motifs in the human immunoglobulin heavy - chain gene enhancer .,O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I I O O B I I I I I I O
"Furthermore , a mutant E6 motif lost both in vitro binding activity and in vivo enhancer activity .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In striking contrast to the mouse Ig heavy - chain enhancer , in which the octamer motif acts as a B - cell - specific enhancer element , the human enhancer contains an octamerlike sequence with one base substitution which bound octamer - binding proteins with only very low affinity and showed no enhancer activity of its own .",O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O B I O O O B I I I I I I O O B I O O B I O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Moreover , simian virus 40 enhancer activity was blocked by the MnlI - AluI fragment in HeLa cells but not in B cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O
Human T and B lymphocytes demonstrate an early and transient hyperpolarization after ligand binding .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Inasmuch as the change in membrane potential is dependent on elevation of free cytosolic calcium , the hyperpolarization is presumably through opening of Ca ( 2 + ) - stimulated K + channels .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We have used charybdotoxin , a known inhibitor of Ca ( 2 + ) - dependent K + channels , to study the role of these channels in lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis .",O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"We demonstrate that charybdotoxin inhibits the ligand - induced transient membrane hyperpolarization in B and T cells in a dose - dependent fashion , without affecting changes in cytosolic Ca2 + .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results imply that membrane potential changes secondary to the ligand - dependent opening of Ca ( 2 + ) - activated K + channels are not involved in B and T lymphocyte activation and mitogenesis .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Activity of the kappa B enhancer of the interleukin - 2 receptor alpha chain in somatic cell hybrids is accompanied by the nuclear localization of NF - kappa B .,O O O B I I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"The two nuclear proteins NF - kappa B ( consisting of subunits p50 an dp65 ) and the DNA - binding subunit of NF - kappa B ( p50 ) by itself , also called KBF1 , are constitutively expressed and localized in the nucleus of the human T - cell line IARC 301 . 5 .",O B I I B I I I O O O O B O B O O O B I I I O B I I I O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In order to define the roles of these two factors , which bind to the same kappa B enhancers , in transcription activation we have prepared somatic cell hybrids between IARC 301 . 5 and a murine myeloma .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Most hybrids express both KBF1 and NF - kappa B in their nuclei , but one hybrid expresses only KBF1 .",O O O O B O B I I I O O O O O O O O O B O
The kappa B enhancer of the gene encoding the interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) receptor alpha chain ( IL - 2R alpha ) is functional only in the hybrids expressing nuclear NF - kappa B .,O B I I O O O O O B I I I I I I I I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
"These findings show that nuclear NF - kappa B is necessary to activate the kappa B enhancer , while KBF1 by itself is not sufficient .",O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I I O O B O O O O O O
We propose that KBF1 is a competitive inhibitor of NF - kappa B and discuss how these factors may be involved in the transient expression of IL - 2 and IL - 2 alpha genes during the immune response .,O O O B O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O
"T - helper - cell determinants in protein antigens are preferentially located in cysteine - rich antigen segments resistant to proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin B , L , and D .",B I I I I I O B I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I I I I I I O
We report on a computer algorithm capable of predicting the location of T - helper - cell epitopes in protein antigen ( Ag ) by analysing the Ag amino acid sequence .,O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B I O B O O O O B B I I O
"The algorithm was constructed with the aim of identifying segments in Ag which are resistant to proteolytic degradation by the enzymes cathepsin B , L , and D .",O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"These are prominent enzymes in the endocytic pathway through which soluble protein Ag enter APC , and resistant segments in Ag may , therefore , be expected to contain more T - cell determinants than susceptible segments .",O O O B O O O O O O B I I O B O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I O
"Moreover , we have noticed that cysteine - containing T - cell determinants in a number of protein Ag are particularly rich in the amino acids alanine , glycine , lysine , leucine , serine , threonine , and valine .",O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By searching protein Ag for clusters of amino acids containing cysteine and two of the other amino acids we were able to predict 17 out of 23 empirically known T - cell determinants in the Ag with a relatively low number of false ( positive ) predictions .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , we present a new principle for searching Ag for potential amphipatic alpha - helical protein segments .",O O O O O O O O O B O O B I I I I I O
Such segments accord well with empirically known T - cell determinants and our algorithm produces a lower number of false positive predictions than the principle based on discrete Fourier transformations previously described .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Contribution of NF - kappa B and Sp1 binding motifs to the replicative capacity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 : distinct patterns of viral growth are determined by T - cell types .,O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Virus stocks obtained from these experiments exhibited a continuum of replicative capacities in different human T - cell types depending on which element ( s ) was present in the LTR .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O
"For example , in experiments involving proviral clones with LTRs containing one or two NF - kappa B elements ( and no Sp1 binding sites ) , a hierarchy of cellular permissivity to virus replication ( peripheral blood lymphocytes = MT4 greater than H9 greater than CEM greater than Jurkat ) was observed .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of note was the associated emergence of second - site LTR revertants which involved an alteration of the TATA box .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I O
These results suggest that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 LTR possesses functional redundancy which ensures virus replication in different T - cell types and is capable of changing depending on the particular combination of transcriptional factors present .,O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
Stimulation of interferon beta gene transcription in vitro by purified NF - kappa B and a novel TH protein .,O O B I I O O O O O B I I I O O O B I O
"To further characterize the protein - DNA interactions mediating IFN - beta induction , positive regulatory domain ( PRD ) II binding proteins were purified from phorbol ester induced Jurkat T - cells and from IFN primed , cycloheximide / polyinosinic - polycytidylic acid treated HeLa S3 cells .",O O O O O O O O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"From HeLa cells , two major proteins of 52 and 45 kilodaltons ( kD ) copurified with DNA binding activity , whereas from T - cells , four proteins - - a major protein of 52 kD and three minor proteins of 82 , 67 , and 43 - 47 kD - - were purified .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O B I O B O B O O B I I I O O O O O
"Also , an induction specific DNA binding protein was purified from HeLa cells that interacted with the ( AAGTGA ) 4 tetrahexamer sequence and the PRDI domain .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I O
This protein is immunologically distinct from IRF - 1 / ISGF2 .,O O O O O O B I I I I O
Uninduced or Sendai virus induced HeLa extracts were used to examine transcription in vitro using a series of IFN beta promoter deletions .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"Deletions upstream of the PRDII element increased transcription in the uninduced extract , indicating predominantly negative regulation of the promoter .",O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
These experiments demonstrate that it is possible to modulate IFN - beta transcription in vitro but indicate that additional proteins may be required to fully activate IFN - beta transcription .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
The rhombotin family of cysteine - rich LIM - domain oncogenes : distinct members are involved in T - cell translocations to human chromosomes 11p15 and 11p13 .,O B I O B I I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I I O
A chromosomal translocation in a T - cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene .,O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O B I O O B I O
"This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine - rich regions called LIM domains , which show homology to zinc - binding proteins and to iron - sulfur centers of ferredoxins .",O O O O O O O B I I I O B I O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O B O
Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated .,O O O O B I O O O O O
"One of these , designated Rhom - 2 , is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13 , where a cluster of T - cell leukemia - specific translocations occur ; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the Rhom - 2 gene .",O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O B I O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O B O O O O B I I I O
"Rhom - 2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system , lung , kidney , liver , and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus .",B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The other gene , designated Rhom - 3 , is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin .",O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O
"Since the Rhom - 2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T - cell tumors , the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined .",O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example .,O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Therefore , chromosome bands 11p15 ( rhombotin ) and 11p13 ( Rhom - 2 ) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T - cell leukemia , with the 11p15 target more rarely involved .",O O B I I O B O O B O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T - cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine - rich LIM domains .,O O O O B O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I I O
"NF - kappa B is a DNA - binding regulatory factor able to control transcription of a number of genes , including human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) genes .",B I I I O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O
"In T cells , NF - kappa B is activated upon cellular treatment by phorbol esters and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF alpha ) .",O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I O O
"In the present work , we investigated the molecular events leading to NF - kappa B activation by TNF alpha in a human T cell line ( Jurkat ) and its subclone JCT6 , which presents a deficiency in the PKA transduction pathway .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
"We found that in both cell lines , both phorbol ester and TNF alpha were able to activate NF - kappa B .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I I I O
Phorbol activation was positively modulated by Ca2 + influx while TNF alpha activation was not .,O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
TNF alpha did not activate cAMP production and its signal was not modulated by cAMP activators .,B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Moreover , cAMP activators did not activate NF - kappa B in Jurkat cells .",O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O
"Thus , TNF alpha - induced NF - kappa B activation was found to be mediated by none of the major signal - mediating kinases such as protein kinase C ( PKC ) , protein kinase A , or Ca ( 2 + ) - regulated kinases .",O O B I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I O B O O B I I O O B I I I I I I I O
"Furthermore , we found that cytoplasmic acidification facilitated NF - kappa B activation by both TNF alpha and PKC , by a mechanism that increases NF - kappa B / I kappa B dissociation without affecting the NF - kappa B translocation step .",O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I O B O O O O O O B I I I B I I I O O O O B I I I O O O
The functional domains of the murine Thy - 1 gene promoter .,O O O O O B I I I I I O
"The Thy - 1 gene promoter resembles a ` ` housekeeping ' ' promoter in that it is located within a methylation - free island , lacks a canonical TATA box , and displays heterogeneity in the 5 ' - end termini of the mRNA .",O B I I I I O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I O O O O O O B I I I I O O B O
"Using transgenic mice , we show that this promoter does not confer any tissue specificity and is active only in a position - dependent manner .",O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It can only be activated in a tissue - specific manner by elements that lie downstream of the initiation site .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
"We have analyzed the functional domains of the minimal Thy - 1 promoter and show that the dominant promoter elements consist of multiple binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 , an inverted CCAAT box , and sequences proximal to the transcription start site .",O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I O O B I I O O B I B O O O B I O O O O O O B I I O
"DNase I and gel mobility shift assays show the binding of a number of nuclear factors to these elements , including Sp1 and CP1 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B O O B O B O

Nuclear factor kappa B activates proenkephalin transcription in T lymphocytes .,B I I I O O O O O O O
"Upon activation , T lymphocytes accumulate high levels of the neuropeptide enkephalin which correlate with high levels of proenkephalin mRNA in the cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
"The proenkephalin promoter contains a sequence GGGGACGTCCCC , named B2 , which is similar to the kappa B sequence GGGGACTTTCC , the binding site of the transcription factor nuclear factor ( NF ) - kappa B .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O B I B I I I I I I I O
"Activation of T lymphocytes induces an NF - kappa B - like binding activity to the B2 site , concomitant with activation of the proenkephalin promoter .",O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I O
"Thus , it appears that the T - cell - specific activation of the proenkephalin promoter is mediated by NF - kappa B .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I I O

"Interestingly , coincubation of 35S - TR alpha 1 , GH3 NE , and unlabeled TREp resulted in not only the 35S - TR : TREp complex , but in two additional more greatly retarded complexes containing 35S - TR alpha 1 and comigrating with those formed by GH3 extract alone .",O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O

Three aspects of the involvement of tumor necrosis factor in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pathogenesis were examined .,O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
"TNF - alpha RNA was undetectable in U937 cells , whereas a low constitutive level was detected in U9 - IIIB cells .",B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Paramyxovirus infection induced a 5 - to 10 - fold increase in the steady - state level of TNF - alpha RNA in U9 - IIIB cells compared with U937 cells , suggesting that HIV - infected monocytic cells produced higher levels of TNF - alpha than did normal cells after a secondary virus infection .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O

"In U937 and Jurkat T lymphoid cells , the inducibility of the different hybrid promoters by TNF - alpha or phorbol ester varied in a cell type - and promoter context - specific manner ; the levels of gene activity of NF - kappa B - containing plasmids correlated directly with induction of NF - kappa B DNA - binding activity .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O B I I I O O O O O
"Although the intact beta interferon promoter was only weakly stimulated by phorbol ester or TNF - alpha , multimers of the PRDII NF - kappa B - binding domain were inducible by both agents .",O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O

Steroid dose sparing : pharmacodynamic responses to single versus divided doses of methylprednisolone in man .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two types of responses were compared after a single MP dose ( 40 mg bolus ) and a divided regimen ( 20 mg bolus and a 5 mg bolus 8 hours later ) in six healthy male volunteers .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The suppression of basophils measured as whole blood histamine and plasma cortisol concentrations was assessed during 32 hours .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 37 . 5 % reduction in dose produced a 23 % overall decreased blood histamine response .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A pharmacodynamic model for basophil cell distribution to and from an extravascular compartment describes the effects of MP after both regimens .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A slower initial decline in blood histamine after the divided regimen may be related to incomplete suppression of basophil cell return to blood .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of MP of about 5 ng / ml were similar for both regimens .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The decline and return of cortisol concentrations were similar between MP treatments with suppression continuing for 24 hours .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of MP values for adrenal suppression were about 1 ng / ml .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pharmacodynamic modeling is useful in quantitating corticosteroid responses and generally predicted the ` ` dose - sparing ' ' effects that were achieved by prolonging MP plasma concentrations .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"As expected for proteins of this class , the CREB proteins bind DNA as dimers .",O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
The presence of multiple CREB isoforms with identical DNA - binding specificities but differences in the presumed regulatory domain raises the possibility that CREB proteins may be able to integrate distinct regulatory signals at the level of gene transcription .,O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"A group of coordinately induced protooncogenes , cytoskeletal , and extracellular matrix genes have been termed immediate early response genes , and their induction has been associated with growth factor - stimulated cell proliferation .",O O O O O B O B I I I I I O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O

"TCF - 1 alpha , originally identified and purified through its binding sites on the HIV - 1 promoter , was found to bind to the TCR alpha enhancer and to promoters for several genes expressed at significantly earlier stages of T - cell development than the TCR alpha gene ( e . g . , p56lck and CD3 delta ) .",B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O B O B I O O

"Southwestern and gel renaturation experiments with the use of purified protein fractions revealed that TCF - 1 alpha activity is derived from a family of 57 - to 53 - kD proteins that are abundantly expressed in mature and immature T - cell lines ( Jurkat , CCRF - CEM ) and not in mature B cells ( JY , Namalwa ) or nonlymphoid ( HeLa ) cell lines .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A small 95 - bp fragment of the TCR alpha control region that contains the TCF - 1 alpha binding site juxtaposed between a cAMP - response element ( the CRE or T alpha 1 motif ) and the binding site for a distinct lymphoid - specific protein ( TCF - 2 alpha ) behaved as a potent T - cell - specific enhancer in vivo .,O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I I I I O O O B I I I O O B O B I I I O O O B I O O O B I I I O B I I I O O O O O B I I I I I O O O

"The OTF interactions we observed extended over the heptamer element 5 ' - CTCAGGA - 3 ' , and it seems likely that the binding of the purified factors involves cooperation between octamer and heptamer sites in this promoter .",O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I I I O O B O

The reason that only certain individuals of particular major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) haplotypes can mount T - cell responses against a given antigen of pathogens is found in the fact that T - cell receptors are designed to recognize 18 - 20 residue - long peptide fragments sandwiched between two alpha - helices of class I or class II MHC molecules .,O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I O O O O O O

A number of cytokines and growth factors use the JAK - STAT pathway to signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus .,O O O B O B I O O B B I O O O O O O O O O O O

Recent evidence for a preferential coupling of JAK3 to interleukin - 2 receptor - gamma ( IL - 2R gamma ) and JAK1 to IL - 2R beta supports the concept of heterotrans - activation of JAK1 and JAK3 caused by IL - 2 - induced heterodimerization of their receptor partners .,O O O O O O O B O B I I I I I O B I I I O O B O B I I I O O O O O O O O B O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O

"Moreover , STAT5 was found to be the predominant STAT transcription factor used by IL - 2 in human T cells , and specifically required a COOH - terminal region of IL - 2R beta ( Ser386 - Val525 ) , while STAT5 recruitment was not correlated to activation of IL - 2R gamma or JAK3 .",O O B O O O O O O B I I O O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I I I O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O B I I I O B O

"If , as the literature suggests , NK activity is relevant to breast cancer control , and since ER - tumors have a worse prognosis , we suggest here that perhaps such tumors are resistant to control by NK cells because they lack the ability to attract an accumulation of effector cells to the tumor site , or because blocking factors at the site of the tumor prevent local tumor control at the site of action .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Regulation of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor and E - selectin expression in endothelial cells by cyclosporin A and the T - cell transcription factor NFAT .,O O B I I I I I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I B O
Nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) was originally described as a T - cell - specific transcription factor athat supported the activation of cytokine gene expression and mediated the immunoregulatory effects of cyclosporin A ( CsA ) .,B I I I I I O B O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
"As we observed that activated endothelial cells also expressed NFAT , we tested the antiinflammatory properties of CsA in endothelial cells .",O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O

In this report we have asked which region ( s ) of the steroid receptor are important for mediating lysis in leukemic T lymphoblasts .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
"CEM - ICR 27 leukemic lymphoblasts , a clone of CEM cells which lack functional glucocorticoid receptors and therefore are neither lysed by dexamethasone nor capable of showing glutamine synthetase induction , were provided with steroid receptors by DNA transfections of various receptor gene constructs .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O

HMG - I binds to GATA motifs : implications for an HPFH syndrome .,B I I O O B I O O O O O O O
We have examined binding of the nuclear protein HMG - I to the human gamma - globin promoter .,O O O O O O B I B I I O O B I I I I O
We find that HMG - I binds preferentially to the more 3 ' of a pair of GATA motifs in the gamma - globin promoter ; this paired motif is bound by the erythroid factor GATA - 1 .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O B I I I I O
A naturally occurring mutation ( - 175 T - C ) in the area bound by HMG - I results in overexpression of gamma - globin in adult red blood cells ( HPFH ) and up - regulation of the gamma - globin promoter in in vitro expression assays ; HMG - I does not bind to this mutant sequence .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O B I I O O O O O B I O
A survey of GATA motifs from other globin cis - elements demonstrates HMG - I binding to most of them .,O O O B I O O B I I I O B I I O O O O O O
These findings implicate HMG - I in the HPFH phenotype ; we speculate that it may participate in the formation of multiprotein complexes that regulate globin gene expression .,O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O

"The viral encoded protein tax , is thought to play an important role in oncogenesis .",O B I I B O O O O O O O O O O O
"Our previous data obtained from a tax transgenic mouse model revealed that tax transforms mouse fibroblasts but not thymocytes , despite comparable levels of tax expression in both tissues .",O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
"Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130 - kD protein ( s ) was observed in the tax transformed fibroblast B line and in HTLV - 1 transformed human lymphoid lines , but not in thymocytes from Thy - tax transgenic mice .",O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis with a set of Jak kinase specific antibodies , identified p130 as Jak2 in the tax transformed mouse fibroblastic cell line and Jak3 in HTLV - 1 transformed human T cell lines .",O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O B O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Phosphorylation of Jak2 in tax transformed cells resulted from high expression of IL - 6 .,O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both phosphorylation and proliferation were inhibited by IL - 6 neutralizing antibodies .,O O O O O O O B I I I I O

Hydroxyurea ( HU ) is an antitumor agent which also induces hemoglobinization during erythroid differentiation .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"To further understand its mechanism of action , we investigated the effects of HU on regulation of c - jun expression prior to the onset of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
The levels of c - jun mRNA was elevated 4 to 7 . 5 - fold by HU within 2 h .,O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was followed by a gradual decline to the basal level by 24 h .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both nuclear run - on and actinomycin D pulse experiments strongly indicate that HU regulates c - jun mRNA expression by increasing the rate of synthesis as well as stabilizing the c - jun mRNA .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
"In addition , the level of jun protein was elevated by 2 to 5 - fold within 4 h in HU treated cells .",O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Furthermore , concentrations of HU below 250 microM slightly increased the 5X AP - 1 / CAT activity .",O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I O O

There was a significant decrease in PWM - induced B - cell mitogenesis and a more pronounced effect of DEX administered in vitro on spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation after MET treatment when compared with the DEX plus MET pretreated condition in vivo .,O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data suggest that the inhibition of spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation by glucocorticoids in vitro is related to glucocorticoid receptor function .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
The decrease in PWM - generated B - cell proliferation following cortisol depletion by MET may be seen in connection with impaired glucocorticoid - mediated induction of interleukin - 1 receptor synthesis .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O

Oncogenicity of human papillomavirus - or adenovirus - transformed cells correlates with resistance to lysis by natural killer cells .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The reasons for the dissimilar oncogenicities of human adenoviruses and human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) in humans are unknown but may relate to differences in the capacities of the E1A and E7 proteins to target cells for rejection by the host natural killer ( NK ) cell response .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"The ability of IFN - activated NK cells to selectively kill virally transformed cells depends on IFN ' s ability to induce resistance to NK cell lysis in normal ( i . e . , non - viral oncogene - expressing ) but not virally transformed cells .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"E1A blocked IFN ' s induction of cytolytic resistance , resulting in the selective lysis of adenovirus - transformed cells by IFN - activated NK cells .",B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The extent of IFN - induced NK cell killing of E1A - expressing cells was proportional to the level of E1A expression and correlated with the ability of E1A to block IFN - stimulated gene expression in target cells .,O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O

"We delineated an element conferring both DNA binding by the receptor in vitro and 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 - mediated repression in vivo to a short 40 - bp region encompassing an important positive regulatory element , NF - AT - 1 , which is bound by a T - cell - specific transcription factor , NFATp , as well as by AP - 1 .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O B I I O B I I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I I O B O O O O O B I I O
"VDR DNA - binding mutants were unable to either bind to this element in vitro or repress in vivo ; the VDR DNA - binding domain alone , however , bound the element but also could not repress IL - 2 expression .",B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
These results indicate that DNA binding by VDR is necessary but not sufficient to mediate IL - 2 repression .,O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O B I I O O

Tissue - specific regulation of the rabbit 15 - lipoxygenase gene in erythroid cells by a transcriptional silencer .,O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I O

We demonstrate in this report that the 5 ' flanking DNA of the 15 - lox gene contains sequences which down - regulate its activity in a variety of non - erythroid cell lines but not in two erythroid cell lines .,O O O O O O O B I I I O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The element has characteristics of a transcriptional ' silencer ' since it functions in both orientations .,O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O

Phosphorylation of the transcription factor NFATp inhibits its DNA binding activity in cyclosporin A - treated human B and T cells .,O O O B I B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Cyclosporin A ( CsA ) exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , thus preventing transcriptional induction of several cytokine genes .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O

"This inhibitory effect was limited to the first 2 h after mitogenic activation , localizing the time - frame of action of cysteamine to within the commitment period .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"It therefore was of interest to establish which , if any , commitment events were affected by oxidative signalling during cell cycle entry .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Taking the IL - 2 gene as a candidate , we examined the effect of cysteamine treatment on early gene expression during lymphocyte activation , and on the activity of transcription factors AP - 1 , NF - kappa B , NF - AT and Oct1 , whose functions are required for expression of the IL - 2 mRNA .",O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I B I I O B I I I O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
"The inhibitory effect of cysteamine may be mediated at least in part by an effect on transcription factor function , as the DNA binding activities of AP - 1 and NF - kappa B extracted from mitogen - stimulated cells were significantly inhibited by cysteamine treatment .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
